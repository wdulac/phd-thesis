	abstract = {Recent research has strengthened the understanding of the links between climate and tropical cyclones ({TCs}) on various timescales. Geological records of past climates have shown century-long variations in {TC} numbers. While no significant trends have been identified in the Atlantic since the late 19th century, significant observed trends in {TC} numbers and intensities have occurred in this basin over the past few decades, and trends in other basins are increasingly being identified. However, understanding of the causes of these trends is incomplete, and confidence in these trends continues to be hampered by a lack of consistent observations in some basins. A theoretical basis for maximum {TC} intensity appears now to be well established, but a climate theory of {TC} formation remains elusive. Climate models mostly continue to predict future decreases in global {TC} numbers, projected increases in the intensities of the strongest storms and increased rainfall rates. Sea level rise will likely contribute toward increased storm surge risk. Against the background of global climate change and sea level rise, it is important to carry out quantitative assessments on the potential risk of {TC}-induced storm surge and flooding to densely populated cities and river deltas. Several climate models are now able to generate a good distribution of both {TC} numbers and intensities in the current climate. Inconsistent {TC} projection results emerge from modeling studies due to different downscaling methodologies and warming scenarios, inconsistencies in projected changes of large-scale conditions, and differences in model physics and tracking algorithms. {WIREs} Clim Change 2016, 7:65–89. doi: 10.1002/wcc.371 This article is categorized under: Paleoclimates and Current Trends {\textgreater} Earth System Behavior},

	abstract = {In this review, we provide a historical overview of the simulation of tropical cyclones ({TCs}) in climate models, from the first attempts in the 1970s to the current state-of-the-art models. We discuss the status of {TC} simulation across multiple time scales, from intraseasonal, seasonal, and decadal, to climate change. One of the limitations on the simulation of {TCs} in climate models has been, and continues to be, balancing the high resolution necessary to accurately simulate {TCs} themselves with the need to run simulations for many years and using many ensemble members. Several approaches to inferring {TC} activity indirectly, rather than relying on the models own under-resolved {TCs}, are reviewed, including the use of {TC} genesis indices based on the large-scale environment and downscaling methods such as the use of regional climate models and statistical–dynamical techniques. We also provide an update on the status of climate change projections from the current class of models, where it is feasible to directly track the model's {TCs}. While there has been great progress in the capability of climate models to simulate {TCs} and provide useful forecasts and projections across multiple time scales, there remains much work to be done. We list some of the sources of uncertainty and model sensitivity, describe where improvements are necessary, and provide a few suggestions for promising research directions. {WIREs} Clim Change 2016, 7:211–237. doi: 10.1002/wcc.373 This article is categorized under: Climate Models and Modeling {\textgreater} Knowledge Generation with Models},

	abstract = {Atlantic hurricanes and their sensitivity to anthropogenic warming are investigated using very high (0.5°·0.5° over the Atlantic domain) resolution global simulations. The {ARPEGE}-Climat variable resolution grid demonstrates its usefulness in regional climate studies since resolution can be multiplied by a factor of 2.5 over the domain of interest compared to a uniform grid, for a similar computer cost. The question of hurricane characteristics dependence on anthropogenic warming is tackled trough the implementation of a tracking method. Changes in the total number, as well as locations, of hurricanes appear to depend more on sea surface temperature ({SST}) spatial patterns anomaly than Atlantic mean intensity, essentially through the change in large scale vertical wind shear. A uniform {SST} anomaly forcing produces increased and eastward shifted systems while a spatially contrasted anomaly leads to a decrease. Comparison between cyclogenesis density calculated from tracking or large scale combined variables (as a modiﬁed Gray parameter) brings some conﬁdence in the use of the latter to investigate low resolution simulations. Mean hurricane dynamical characteristics are weakly changed by the warming but precipitation core and latent heat ﬂux are enhanced in all scenarios.},

	abstract = {A diagnostic framework is developed to explain the response of tropical cyclones ({TCs}) to climate in high-resolution global atmospheric models having different complexity of boundary conditions. The framework uses vortex dynamics to identify the large-scale control on the evolution of {TC} precursors—first non-rotating convective clusters and then weakly rotating seeds. In experiments with perturbed sea surface temperature ({SST}) and {CO}2 concentration from the historical values, the response of {TCs} follows the response of seeds. The distribution of seeds is explained by the distribution of the non-rotating convective clusters multiplied by a probability that they transition to seeds. The distribution of convective clusters is constrained by the large-scale vertical velocity and is verified in aquaplanet experiments with shifting Inter tropical Convergence Zones. The probability of transition to seeds is constrained by the large-scale vorticity via an analytical function, representing the relative importance between vortex stretching and vorticity advection, and is verified in aquaplanet experiments with uniform {SST}. The consistency between seed and {TC} responses breaks down substantially when the realistic {SST} is perturbed such that the spatial gradient is significantly enhanced or reduced. In such cases, the difference between the responses is explained by a change in the ventilation index, which influences the fraction of seeds that develop into {TCs}. The proposed {TC}-climate relationship serves as a framework to explain the diversity of {TC} projection across models and forcing scenarios.},

These forecasts covered 10 Atlantic tropical cyclones: 6 from the 2005 season and 4 from 2007. The forecasts were integrated from identical initial conditions produced by a cycling ensemble Kalman filter. The high-resolution forecasts used moving, storm-centered nests of 4- and 1.33-km grid spacing. The coarse-resolution forecasts consisted of a single 12-km domain (which was identical to the outer domain in the forecasts with nests). Forecasts were evaluated out to 120 h. Novel verification techniques were developed to evaluate forecasts of wind radii and the degree of storm asymmetry. Intensity (maximum wind) and rapid intensification, as well as wind radii, were all predicted more accurately with increased horizontal resolution. These results were deemed to be statistically significant based on the application of bootstrap confidence intervals. No statistically significant differences emerged regarding storm position errors between the two forecasts. Coarse-resolution forecasts tended to overpredict the extent of winds compared to high-resolution forecasts. The asymmetry of gale-force winds was better predicted in the coarser-resolution simulation, but asymmetry of hurricane-force winds was predicted better at high resolution. The skill of the wind radii forecasts decayed gradually over 120 h, suggesting a synoptic-scale control of the predictability of outer winds.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

The reinforcement of this shear results from (i) a heat low, related to a precipitation anomaly, which triggers westerly winds equatorward of the initiation region and (ii) an easterly wind strengthening south of the initiation regions due either to a reinforcement of the subtropical high (for western and central {SIO}) or to a large-scale depression over the western Maritime Continent (for eastern {SIO}).

	abstract = {This study examines the large-scale factors that govern global tropical cyclone ({TC}) formation and an upper bound on the annual number of {TCs}. Using idealized simulations for an aqua-planet tropical channel, it is shown that the tropical atmosphere has a maximum capacity in generating {TCs}, even under ideal environmental conditions. Regardless of how favorable the tropical environment is, the total number of {TCs} generated in the tropical channel possesses a consistent cap across experiments. Analyses of daily {TC} genesis events reveal further that global {TC} formation is intermittent throughout the year in a series of episodes at a 2-week frequency, with a cap of 8-10 genesis events per episode. Examination of different large-scale environmental factors shows that 600-{hPa} moisture content, 850-{hPa} absolute vorticity, and vertical wind shear are the most critical factors for this global episodic {TC} formation. Specifically, both the 850 {hPa} absolute vorticity and the 600 {hPa} moisture are relatively higher at the onset of {TC} formation episodes. Once {TCs} form and move to poleward, the total moisture content and the absolute vorticity in the main genesis region subside, thus reducing large-scale instability and producing an unfavorable environment for {TCs} to form. It takes \${\textbackslash}sim\$2 weeks for the tropical atmosphere to remoisten and rebuild the large-scale instability associated with the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone before a new {TC} formation episode can occur. These results offer new insight into the processes that control the upper bound on the global number of {TCs} in the range of 80-100 annually.},

These indices are: the Genesis Potential Index; the Yearly Genesis Parameter; the Modified Yearly Convective Genesis Potential Index; and the Tippett et al. Index (J Clim, 2011), hereafter referred to as {TCS}. Choosing {ERA}40, {NCEP}2, {NCEP} or {JRA}25 reanalysis to calculate these indices can yield regional differences but overall does not change the main conclusions arising from this study. By contrast, differences between indices are large and vary depending on the regions and on the timescales considered. All indices except the {TCS} show an equatorward bias in mean cyclogenesis, especially in the northern hemisphere where this bias can reach 5°. Mean simulated genesis numbers for all indices exhibit large regional discrepancies, which can commonly reach up to ±50\%. For the seasonal timescales on which the indices are historically fitted, performances also vary widely in terms of amplitude although in general they all reproduce the cyclogenesis seasonality adequately. At the seasonal scale, the {TCS} seems to be the best fitted index overall. The most striking feature at interannual scales is the inability of all indices to reproduce the observed cyclogenesis amplitude. The indices also lack the ability to reproduce the general interannual phase variability, but they do, however, acceptably reproduce the phase variability linked to El Niño/Southern Oscillation ({ENSO})—a major driver of tropical cyclones interannual variations. In terms of cyclogenesis mechanisms that can be inferred from the analysis of the index terms, there are wide variations from one index to another at seasonal and interannual timescales and caution is advised when using these terms from one index only. They do, however, show a very good coherence at {ENSO} scale thus inspiring confidence in the mechanism interpretations that can be obtained by the use of any index. Finally, part of the gap between the observed and simulated cyclogenesis amplitudes may be attributable to stochastic processes, which cannot be inferred from environmental indices that only represent a potential for cyclogenesis.},

Using cyclone trajectories derived from 6-hourly data, a comprehensive set of metrics is defined to systematically compare and contrast products with one another. In addition to annual {TC} climatologies, attention is paid to spatial and temporal patterns of storm occurrence and intensity. Assessment can be performed either on the global scale or for regional domains. Simple-to-visualize “scorecards” allow for rapid credibility assessment. We showcase three key findings enabled by this suite. First, we compare the representation of {TCs} in seven current-generation global reanalyses and conclude that higher-resolution models and those with {TC}-specific assimilation contain more accurate storm climatologies. Second, using a free-running Earth system model ({ESM}) we find that full basin refinement is required in variable-resolution configurations to adequately simulate North Atlantic Ocean {TC} frequency. Upstream refinement over northern Africa offers little benefit in simulating storm occurrence, but spatial genesis patterns are improved. We also show that {TCs} simulated by {ESMs} can be highly sensitive to individual parameterizations in climate models, with North Atlantic {TC} metrics varying greatly depending on the version of the Morrison–Gettelman microphysics package that is used.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

Minimum sea level pressure is estimated from aircraft reconnaissance or measured from dropwindsondes, and maximum wind speeds are interpolated from best-track maximum 1-min wind speed estimates. The aircraft data were collected primarily in the Atlantic but also include eastern and central North Pacific cases. Global numerical analyses were used to estimate tropical cyclone size and environmental pressure associated with each observation. Using this dataset (3801 points), the influences of latitude, tropical cyclone size, environmental pressure, and intensification trend on the tropical cyclone wind–pressure relationships were examined. Findings suggest that latitude, size, and environmental pressure, which all can be quantified in an operational and postanalysis setting, are related to predictable changes in the wind–pressure relationships. These factors can be combined into equations that estimate winds given pressure and estimate pressure given winds with greater accuracy than current methodologies. In independent testing during the 2005 hurricane season (524 cases), these new wind–pressure relationships resulted in mean absolute errors of 5.3 {hPa} and 6.2 kt compared with the 7.7 {hPa} and 9.0 kt that resulted from using the standard Atlantic Dvorak wind–pressure relationship. These new wind–pressure relationships are then used to evaluate several operational wind–pressure relationships. These intercomparisons have led to several recommendations for operational tropical cyclone centers and those interested in reanalyzing past tropical cyclone events.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

As with a previous downscaling of {CMIP}5 models, the results show an increase in both the frequency and severity of tropical cyclones, robust across the models downscaled, in response to increasing greenhouse gases. The increase is strongly weighted to the Northern Hemisphere, and especially noteworthy is a large increase in the higher latitudes of the North Atlantic. Changes are insignificant in the South Pacific across metrics. Although the largest increases in track density are far from land, substantial increases in global landfalling power dissipation are indicated. The incidence of rapid intensification increases rapidly with warming, as predicted by existing theory.

Global climate models are currently used to estimate future climate change, but the current generation of models lacks the horizontal resolution necessary to resolve the intense inner core of tropical cyclones. Here we review a new technique for inferring tropical cyclone climatology from the output of global models, extend it to predict genesis climatologies (rather than relying on historical climatology), and apply it to current and future climate states simulated by a suite of global models developed in support of the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}This new technique attacks the horizontal resolution problem by using a specialized, coupled ocean-atmosphere hurricane model phrased in angular momentum coordinates, which provide a high resolution of the core at low cost. This model is run along each of 2,000 storm tracks generated using an advection-and-beta model, which is, in turn, driven by large-scale winds derived from the global models. In an extension to this method, tracks are initiated by randomly seeding large areas of the tropics with weak vortices and then allowing the intensity model to determine their survival, based on large-scale environmental conditions. We show that this method is largely successful in reproducing the observed seasonal cycle and interannual variability of tropical cyclones in the present climate, and that it is more modestly successful in simulating their spatial distribution. When applied to simulations of global climate with double the present concentration of carbon dioxide, this method predicts substantial changes and geographic shifts in tropical cyclone activity, but with much variation among the global climate models used. Basinwide power dissipation and storm intensity generally increase with global warming, but the results vary from model to model and from basin to basin. Storm frequency decreases in the Southern Hemisphere and north Indian Ocean, increases in the western North Pacific, and is indeterminate elsewhere. We demonstrate that in these simulations, the change in tropical cyclone activity is greatly influenced by the increasing difference between the moist entropy of the boundary layer and that of the middle troposphere as the climate warms.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

The authors examine how different environmental factors contribute to this influence, using a genesis potential index developed by Emanuel and Nolan. Four factors contribute to the genesis potential index: low-level vorticity (850 {hPa}), relative humidity at 600 {hPa}, the magnitude of vertical wind shear from 850 to 200 {hPa}, and potential intensity ({PI}). Using monthly {NCEP} Reanalysis data in the period of 1950–2005, the genesis potential index is calculated on a latitude strip from 60°S to 60°N. Composite anomalies of the genesis potential index are produced for El Niño and La Niña years separately. These composites qualitatively replicate the observed interannual variations of the observed frequency and location of genesis in several different basins. This justifies producing composites of modified indices in which only one of the contributing factors varies, with the others set to climatology, to determine which among the factors are most important in causing interannual variations in genesis frequency. Specific factors that have more influence than others in different regions can be identified. For example, in El Niño years, relative humidity and vertical shear are important for the reduction in genesis seen in the Atlantic basin, and relative humidity and vorticity are important for the eastward shift in the mean genesis location in the western North Pacific.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {In order to make inferences on the possible future changes of tropical cyclogenesis frequency, we apply the diagnostic computation of the Yearly Genesis Parameter ({YGP}) proposed by Gray (1975) to the large-scale fields simulated by a {GCM}. The {YGP} is an empirical diagnostic of the frequency of Tropical Cyclones ({TCs}) based on six physical parameters computed from seasonal means of atmospheric and oceanic variables. In this paper, we apply the {YGP} diagnostic to the results of three climate simulations performed with the atmospheric General Circulation Model ({GCM}) of Météo-France: {ARPEGE}-Climat. In a control simulation of the current climate, it is shown that the model has a realistic tropical climatology and that the computed {YGP} reproduces the geographical distribution of the tropical cyclogenesis frequency. The {YGP} is then applied to two simulations corresponding to two scenarios of doubled carbon dioxide concentration. The two experiments differ by the sea surface temperatures ({SSTs}) used as a lower boundary condition. In both simulations the {YGP} gives a large increase of total cyclogenesis frequency, but without extension of the area of possible cyclone genesis. The increase in {YGP} is due essentially to the contribution of the ocean thermal energy factor in the thermodynamical potential. The dynamical parameters, on the contrary, limit the cyclogenesis increase and are a major explanation of the difference between the two experiments. This is in agreement with the results of the previous similar study of Ryan et al. (1992) concerning the importance of large-scale atmospheric circulation modifications on tropical cyclone climatology. After discussing the observed relationships between ocean surface temperature and large-scale convection, and questioning the use of a fixed temperature threshold in the diagnosis of tropical cyclone frequency, we propose a modification to the {YGP} consisting in replacing the thermodynamical potential by a term proportional to the convective precipitation computed by the {GCM}. For the simulation of the present climate this modification affects only marginally the geographical distribution of tropical cyclone genesis, but for the doubled {CO}2 case, the modified {YGP} diagnoses a more limited increase in {TC} genesis in the Northern Hemisphere and a small reduction in the Southern Hemisphere, which seems in better agreement with other recent modelling studies with high resolution climate models (Bengtsson et al., 1996). We conclude that the modified {YGP} based on convective precipitation could serve as a useful diagnostic of tropical cyclone genesis, and should be tested in simulations with other {GCMs}.},

Extensive correlation analyses were carried out between {TC} frequency and intensity and the aforementioned large-scale parameters, using {TC} data for 1970–2006 from the official Australian {TC} dataset. Large correlations were found between the seasonal number of {TCs} and {SST} in the Niño-3.4 and Niño-4 regions. These correlations were greatest (−0.73) during August–October, immediately preceding the Australian {TC} season. The correlations remain almost unchanged for the July–September period and therefore can be viewed as potential seasonal predictors of the forthcoming {TC} season. In contrast, only weak correlations (\&lt;+0.37) were found with the local {SST} in the region north of Australia where many {TCs} originate; these were reduced almost to zero when the {ENSO} component of the {SST} was removed by partial correlation analysis. The annual frequency of {TCs} was found to be strongly correlated with 850-{hPa} relative vorticity and vertical shear of the zonal wind over the main genesis areas of the Australian region. Furthermore, correlations between the Niño {SST} and these two atmospheric parameters exhibited a strong link between the Australian region and the Niño-3.4 {SST}. A principal component analysis of the {SST} dataset revealed two main modes of Pacific Ocean {SST} variability that match very closely with the basinwide patterns of correlations between {SST} and {TC} frequencies. Finally, it is shown that the correlations can be increased markedly (e.g., from −0.73 to −0.80 for the August–October period) by a weighted combination of {SST} time series from weakly correlated regions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

Another method derived from the data presented herein, the so-called offset method, is used to develop a baseline standard for the aforementioned schemes, using the observed storm motions and the mean wind. It is not a forecast scheme, as it is based on knowing the observed storm motions. This work explores the sensitivity of these algorithms to their arbitrary parameters by systematically varying those parameters, using a dataset of 394 right-moving supercells, and associated proximity soundings. The parameters used in these algorithms to define the layer depths for advection and/or propagation of supercells have not been shown to be optimum for this purpose. These arbitrary parameters compose the top and bottom levels of the mean wind layer, and a deviation vector from the mean wind defined through that layer. Two of the most recently developed algorithms have also implemented the vertical wind shear vector over an arbitrary layer depth. It has been found that, among other results, the scheme using both mean wind and vertical wind shear is more sensitive to the depth of the mean wind layer than it is to the depth of the vertical wind shear layer. It has also been shown that, when using the simplest schemes, the most accurate forecasts, on average, are obtained by using deep mean wind layers (i.e., greater than 0–10 km). Indeed, all the forecast schemes show a strong tendency for the {\textless}em{\textgreater}u{\textless}/em{\textgreater} component of the predicted storm motion to be regulated by the depth of the mean wind layer. The {\textless}em{\textgreater}υ{\textless}/em{\textgreater} component of the prediction storm motion, on the other hand, appears to be controlled by the deviation vector from the layer-mean wind. Although the schemes using vertical shear are shown to perform somewhat better on average than schemes based on the mean wind alone, there are times in which they also result in large forecast errors. The results demonstrate the inherent difficulty in using an observed hodograph to predict supercell motion.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

In addition to the large-scale conditions, the model is shown to reproduce a wide range of mesoscale convective systems. Tropical cyclones grow from the most intense of these systems formed along the South Pacific convergence zone ({SPCZ}) and sometimes develop into hurricanes. The three-dimensional structure of simulated tropical cyclones is in excellent agreement with dropsondes and satellite observations. The mean seasonal and spatial distributions of {TC} genesis and occurrence are also in good agreement with the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ({JTWC}) data. It is noted, however, that the spatial pattern of {TC} activity is shifted to the northeast because of a similar bias in the environmental forcing. Over the whole genesis area, 8.2 ± 3.5 cyclones are produced seasonally in the model, compared with 6.6 ± 3.0 in the {JTWC} data. Part of the interannual variability is associated with El Niño–Southern Oscillation ({ENSO}). {ENSO}-driven displacement of the {SPCZ} position produces a dipole pattern of correlation and results in a weaker correlation when the opposing correlations of the dipole are amalgamated over the entire South Pacific region. As a result, environmentally forced variability at the regional scale is relatively weak, that is, of comparable order to stochastic variability (±1.7 cyclones yr$^{\textrm{−1}}$), which is estimated from a 10-yr climatological simulation. Stochastic variability appears essentially related to mesoscale interactions, which also affect {TC} tracks and the resulting occurrence.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The relationship between the two common measures of tropical cyclone intensity, the central pressure deficit and the peak near-surface wind speed, is a long-standing problem in tropical meteorology that has been approximated empirically yet lacks physical understanding. Here we provide theoretical grounding for this relationship. We first demonstrate that the central pressure deficit is highly predictable from the low-level wind field via gradient wind balance. We then show that this relationship reduces to a dependence on two velocity scales: the maximum azimuthal-mean azimuthal wind speed and half the product of the Coriolis parameter and outer storm size. This simple theory is found to hold across a hierarchy of models spanning reduced-complexity and Earth-like global simulations and observations. Thus, the central pressure deficit is an intensity measure that combines maximum wind speed, storm size, and background rotation rate. This work has significant implications for both fundamental understanding and risk analysis, including why the central pressure better explains historical economic damages than does maximum wind speed.},

	abstract = {Abstract Atlantic hurricane seasons have a long history of causing significant financial impacts, with Harvey, Irma, Maria, Florence, and Michael combining to incur more than 345 billion {USD} in direct economic damage during 2017–2018. While Michael’s damage was primarily wind and storm surge-driven, Florence’s and Harvey’s damage was predominantly rainfall and inland flood-driven. Several revised scales have been proposed to replace the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale ({SSHWS}), which currently only categorizes the hurricane wind threat, while not explicitly handling the totality of storm impacts including storm surge and rainfall. However, most of these newly-proposed scales are not easily calculated in real-time, nor can they be reliably calculated historically. In particular, they depend on storm wind radii, which remain very uncertain. Herein, we analyze the relationship between normalized historical damage caused by continental United States ({CONUS}) landfalling hurricanes from 1900–2018 with both maximum sustained wind speed (Vmax) and minimum sea level pressure ({MSLP}). We show that {MSLP} is a more skillful predictor of normalized damage than Vmax, with a significantly higher rank correlation between normalized damage and {MSLP} (rrank = 0.77) than between normalized damage and Vmax (rrank = 0.66) for all {CONUS} landfalling hurricanes. {MSLP} has served as a much better predictor of hurricane damage in recent years than Vmax, with large hurricanes such as Ike (2008) and Sandy (2012) causing much more damage than anticipated from their {SSHWS} ranking. {MSLP} is also a more accurately-measured quantity than is Vmax, making it an ideal quantity for evaluating a hurricane’s potential damage.},

	abstract = {Abstract An objectively defined three-dimensional cyclone phase space is proposed and explored. Cyclone phase is described using the parameters of storm-motion-relative thickness asymmetry (symmetric/nonfrontal versus asymmetric/frontal) and vertical derivative of horizontal height gradient (cold- versus warm-core structure via the thermal wind relationship). A cyclone's life cycle can be analyzed within this phase space, providing substantial insight into the cyclone structural evolution. An objective classification of cyclone phase is possible, unifying the basic structural description of tropical, extratropical, and hybrid cyclones into a continuum. Stereotypical symmetric warm-core (tropical cyclone) and asymmetric cold-core (extratropical cyclone) life cycles are illustrated using 1° Navy Operational Global Atmospheric Prediction System ({NOGAPS}) operational analyses and 2.5° {NCEP}–{NCAR} reanalyses. The transitions between cyclone phases are clearly illustrated within the phase space, including extratropical transition, subtropical and tropical transition, and the development of warm seclusions within extratropical cyclones. The planet's northwestern hemisphere inhabitance of the proposed phase space between 1980 and 1999 is examined using {NCEP}–{NCAR} 2.5° reanalyses. Despite the inability to adequately resolve tropical cyclones at the coarse 2.5° resolution, warm-core cyclones (primarily warm-seclusion extratropical cyclones) have a mean intensity that is 10 {hPa} lower than that of cold-core cyclones. Warm-core cyclones also have a much larger variability for intensity distribution, with an increased occurrence of lower {MSLP}. Further, at 2.5° resolution the lowest analyzed {MSLP} for a warm-core cyclone was 14 {hPa} lower than that for a cyclone that remains cold core. These results suggest that cyclones that maintain solely a cold-core structure (no warm-seclusion or tropical development) may be associated with a significantly weaker minimum observed intensity at 2.5° resolution, although further examination using higher-resolution data is required to refine this. Phase diagrams are being produced in real time to improve the forecasting of cyclone phase evolution and phase transitions, and to provide measures of phase predictability through ensembling of multiple models. The likelihood of warm-core development in cyclones can be anticipated by applying the diagnostics to various model forecasts, illuminating the potential for large intensity changes when the explicit model intensity forecasts may be insufficient.},

The analysis focuses on {TCs} that achieve gale-force (17 m s−1) sustained winds. Objective criteria were established to define {TC} tracks once they reach gale force for both observed and detected {TCs}. A lack of consistency between storm tracks preceding this level of intensity led these track segments to be removed from the analysis. A subtropical jet ({STJ}) diagnostic is used to terminate transitioning {TCs} and is found to be preferable to a fixed latitude cutoff point. {TC} tracks were analyzed across seven {TC} basins, using a probabilistic clustering technique that is based on regression mixture models. The technique grouped {TC} tracks together based on their geographical location and shape of trajectory in five separate “cluster regions” around the globe. A mean trajectory was then regressed for each cluster that showed good agreement between the detected and observed tracks. Other track measures such as interannual {TC} days and translational speeds were also replicated to a satisfactory level, with {TC} days showing limited sensitivity to different latitude cutoff points. Successful validation in reanalysis data allows this model- and grid-resolution-independent {TC} tracking scheme to be applied to climate models with confidence in its ability to identify {TC} tracks in coarse-resolution climate models.},

Each model’s transient fully-coupled 2 × {CO}2 {TC} activity response is largely recovered by “time-slice” experiments using time-invariant {SST} perturbations added to each model’s own {SST} climatology. The {TC} response to {SST} forcing depends on each model’s background climatological {SST} biases: removing these biases leads to a global {TC} intensity increase in the {\textasciitilde} 50 km model, and a global {TC} frequency increase in the {\textasciitilde} 25 km model, in response to {CO}2-induced warming patterns and {CO}2 doubling. Isolated {CO}2 doubling leads to a significant {TC} frequency decrease, while isolated uniform {SST} warming leads to a significant global {TC} frequency increase; the {\textasciitilde} 25 km model has a greater tendency for frequency increase. Global {TC} frequency responds to both (1) changes in {TC} “seeds”, which increase due to warming (more so in the {\textasciitilde} 25 km model) and decrease due to higher {CO}2 concentrations, and (2) less efficient development of these“seeds” into {TCs}, largely due to the nonlinear relation between temperature and saturation specific humidity.},

	abstract = {Within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), {ECMWF} is producing the {ERA}5 reanalysis which, once completed, will embody a detailed record of the global atmosphere, land surface and ocean waves from 1950 onwards. This new reanalysis replaces the {ERA}-Interim reanalysis (spanning 1979 onwards) which was started in 2006. {ERA}5 is based on the Integrated Forecasting System ({IFS}) Cy41r2 which was operational in 2016. {ERA}5 thus benefits from a decade of developments in model physics, core dynamics and data assimilation. In addition to a significantly enhanced horizontal resolution of 31 km, compared to 80 km for {ERA}-Interim, {ERA}5 has hourly output throughout, and an uncertainty estimate from an ensemble (3-hourly at half the horizontal resolution). This paper describes the general set-up of {ERA}5, as well as a basic evaluation of characteristics and performance, with a focus on the dataset from 1979 onwards which is currently publicly available. Re-forecasts from {ERA}5 analyses show a gain of up to one day in skill with respect to {ERA}-Interim. Comparison with radiosonde and {PILOT} data prior to assimilation shows an improved fit for temperature, wind and humidity in the troposphere, but not the stratosphere. A comparison with independent buoy data shows a much improved fit for ocean wave height. The uncertainty estimate reflects the evolution of the observing systems used in {ERA}5. The enhanced temporal and spatial resolution allows for a detailed evolution of weather systems. For precipitation, global-mean correlation with monthly-mean {GPCP} data is increased from 67\% to 77\%. In general, low-frequency variability is found to be well represented and from 10 {hPa} downwards general patterns of anomalies in temperature match those from the {ERA}-Interim, {MERRA}-2 and {JRA}-55 reanalyses.},

The major obstacle has been the lack of sufficient ground truth, i.e., actual measurements of maximum wind speeds in tropical cyclones with a wide range of central pressures. In this study 28 years of maximum wind measurements made at coastal and island stations in the western North Pacific were collected and analyzed. Because of problems in measuring and interpreting sustained surface wind speeds, only recorded peak gust values were used. These peak gust values were reduced to a standard anemometer level of 10 m using a power law relationship and then converted to 1 min sustained wind speeds using gust factors representative of an overwater environment. The sample was restricted to cases where it was reasonably certain that the station experienced the cyclone's winds during its passage. The resulting equation,where pc is the minimum sea level pressure (mb) and Vm the maximum sustained (1 min) wind speed (kt), indicates maximum wind speeds that are significantly lower than many previous studies.},

	abstract = {Abstract The evolution of tropical cyclone activity under climate change remains a crucial scientific issue. Physical theory of cyclogenesis is limited, observational datasets suffer from heterogeneities in space and time, and state-of-the-art climate models used for future projections are still too coarse ({\textasciitilde}100 km of resolution) to simulate realistic systems. Two approaches can nevertheless be considered: 1) perform dedicated high-resolution (typically {\textless}50 km) experiments in which tropical cyclones can be tracked and 2) assess cyclone activity from existing low-resolution multimodel climate projections using large-scale indices as proxies. Here we explore these two approaches with a particular focus on the southern Indian Ocean. We first compute high-resolution experiments using the rotated-stretched configuration of our climate model ({CNRM}-{CM}6-1), which is able to simulate realistic tropical cyclones. In a 2-K warmer world, the model projects a 20\% decrease in the frequency of tropical cyclones, together with an increase in their maximum lifetime intensity, a slight poleward shift of their trajectories, and a substantial delay (about 1 month) in the cyclone season onset. Large-scale indices applied to these high-resolution experiments fail to capture the overall decrease in cyclone frequency, but are able to partially represent projected changes in the spatiotemporal distribution of cyclone activity. Last, we apply large-scale indices to multimodel {CMIP}5 projections and find that the seasonal redistribution of cyclone activity is consistent across models.},

	abstract = {Abstract Tropical cyclone genesis indices ({TCGIs}) are functions of the large-scale environment that are designed to be proxies for the probability of tropical cyclone ({TC}) genesis. While the performance of {TCGIs} in the current climate can be assessed by direct comparison to {TC} observations, their ability to represent future {TC} activity based on projections of the large-scale environment cannot. Here the authors examine the performance of {TCGIs} in high-resolution atmospheric model simulations forced with sea surface temperatures ({SST}) of future, warmer climate scenarios. They investigate whether the {TCGIs} derived for the present climate can, when computed from large-scale fields taken from future climate simulations, capture the simulated global mean decreases in {TC} frequency. The {TCGIs} differ in their choice of environmental predictors, and several choices of predictors perform well in the present climate. However, some {TCGIs} that perform well in the present climate do not accurately reproduce the simulated future decrease in {TC} frequency. This decrease is captured when the humidity predictor is the column saturation deficit rather than relative humidity. Using saturation deficit with relative {SST} as the other thermodynamic predictor overpredicts the {TC} frequency decrease, while using potential intensity in place of relative {SST} as the other thermodynamic predictor gives a good prediction of the decrease’s magnitude. These positive results appear to depend on the spatial and seasonal patterns in the imposed {SST} changes; none of the indices capture correctly the frequency decrease in simulations with spatially uniform climate forcings, whether a globally uniform increase in {SST} of 2 K, or a doubling of {CO}2 with no change in {SST}.},

	abstract = {Abstract Almost 70 years ago a sea surface temperature ({SST}) threshold of 26°–27°C, below which tropical cyclones ({TCs}) did not form, was proposed, based on a qualitative assessment of warm-season global {SST} and known {TC} formation regions. This threshold was widely accepted without further testing, until a recent study suggested a threshold of 25.5°C. That study is revisited here by reexamining the {SST} for all global {TC} formations from 1981 to 2008 using (i) a broader range of {SST} threshold values, (ii) an improved method for identifying subtropical storms—any storm that forms poleward of the subtropical jet ({STJ}), and (iii) a range of {TC} formation gestation periods, which refers to a time interval prior to formation in which the {SST} threshold is exceeded for at least one 6-h period. Consequently, thresholds reported in this paper are expressed as a combination of {SST} and gestation period. Using the {STJ} position to identify and exclude subtropical storms, the threshold of 25.5°C {SST}–48-h gestation period was found to be robust, but conservative. An examination of {TCs} of questionable validity (e.g., weak, short lived, and/or storms that formed with baroclinic influences) revealed a further 26 storms (1.2\%) that could arguably be excluded from the analysis. With these storms removed, several {SST}–gestation period threshold combinations were found to be valid, including 25.5°C–18 h and 26.5°C–36 h. A practical threshold combination of 26.5°C–24 h is proposed as only two additional storms failed to meet this threshold, which supports the often-quoted 26.5°C {SST} necessary condition for {TC} formation.},

	abstract = {The tropics are expanding poleward at about \$\$0.5\{{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ \}\$\$ per decade in observations. This poleward expansion of the circulation is consistently reported using Hadley cell edge metrics and lower-atmospheric tropical edge metrics. However, some upper-atmospheric tropical metrics report smaller trends that are often not significant. One such upper-atmospheric metric is the subtropical jet latitude, which has smaller trends compared to the Hadley cell edge. In this study we investigate the robustness of the weak trends in the subtropical jet position by introducing a new method for locating the subtropical jet, and examining the trends and variability of the subtropical jet latitude. We introduce the tropopause gradient method based on the peak gradient in potential temperature along the dynamic tropopause. Using this method we find the trends in the subtropical jet latitude are indeed much smaller than \$\$0.5\{{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ \}\$\$ per decade, consistent with previous studies. We also find that natural variability within the subtropical jet latitude would not prevent trends from being detected if they were similar to the Hadley cell edge, as trends greater than 0.24\$\$\{{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ \}\$\$ per decade could reliably be detected using monthly data or 0.09\$\$\{{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ \}\$\$ per decade using daily data. Despite the poleward expansion of the tropics, there is no robust evidence to suggest the subtropical jet is shifting poleward in either hemisphere. Neither the current diagnostic methods nor natural variability can account for the small subtropical jet trends. The most likely explanation, which requires further investigation, is that the subtropical jet position is not tied dynamically to the Hadley cell edge.},

It has been hypothesized that data from the satellite-borne Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit ({AMSU}) are inadequate to resolve a realistic {TC} warm-core structure. This study first evaluates 13 years of Atmospheric Infrared Sounder ({AIRS}) temperature retrieval against recent dropsonde measurements in {TCs}. {AIRS} can resolve the {TC} warm-core structure well, comparable to the dropsonde observations, although the {AMSU}-A retrievals fail to do so. Using 13-yr {AIRS} data in global {TCs}, a global climatology of the {TC} warm-core structure is generated in this study. The typical warm-core height is at the upper level around 300–400 {hPa} for all {TCs} and increases with {TC} intensity: 400 {hPa} ({\textasciitilde}8 km) for tropical storms, 300 {hPa} ({\textasciitilde}10 km) for category 1–3 hurricanes, 250–300 {hPa} ({\textasciitilde}10–11 km) for category 4 hurricanes, and 150 {hPa} ({\textasciitilde}14 km) for category 5 hurricanes. The range of warm-core height varies with {TC} intensity as well. A strong correlation between {TC} intensity and warm-core strength is found. A weaker but still significant correlation between {TC} intensity and warm-core height is also found.},

A small number of authors have used the direct synoptic identification of phenomena together with a statistical analysis to perform the objective comparison between various datasets. This paper describes a general method for performing the synoptic identification of phenomena that can be used for an objective analysis of atmospheric, or oceanographic, datasets obtained from numerical models and remote sensing. Methods usually associated with image processing have been used to segment the scene and to identify suitable feature points to represent the phenomena of interest. This is performed for each time level. A technique from dynamic scene analysis is then used to link the feature points to form trajectories. The method is fully automatic and should be applicable to a wide range of geophysical fields. An example will be shown of results obtained from this method using data obtained from a run of the Universities Global Atmospheric Modelling Project {GCM}.},

	abstract = {Evolutionary algorithms ({EA}’s) are often well-suited for optimization problems involving several, often conﬂicting objectives. Since 1985, various evolutionary approaches to multiobjective optimization have been developed that are capable of searching for multiple solutions concurrently in a single run. However, the few comparative studies of different methods presented up to now remain mostly qualitative and are often restricted to a few approaches. In this paper, four multiobjective {EA}’s are compared quantitatively where an extended 0/1 knapsack problem is taken as a basis. Furthermore, we introduce a new evolutionary approach to multicriteria optimization, the Strength Pareto {EA} ({SPEA}), that combines several features of previous multiobjective {EA}’s in a unique manner. It is characterized by a) storing nondominated solutions externally in a second, continuously updated population, b) evaluating an individual’s ﬁtness dependent on the number of external nondominated points that dominate it, c) preserving population diversity using the Pareto dominance relationship, and d) incorporating a clustering procedure in order to reduce the nondominated set without destroying its characteristics. The proof-of-principle results obtained on two artiﬁcial problems as well as a larger problem, the synthesis of a digital hardware–software multiprocessor system, suggest that {SPEA} can be very effective in sampling from along the entire Pareto-optimal front and distributing the generated solutions over the tradeoff surface. Moreover, {SPEA} clearly outperforms the other four multiobjective {EA}’s on the 0/1 knapsack problem.},

The problem becomes challenging when the objectives are of conflicting characteristics to each other, that is, the optimal solution of an objective function is different from that of the other. In the course of solving such problems, with or without the presence of constraints, these problems give rise to a set of trade-off optimal solutions, popularly known as Pareto-optimal solutions. Because of the multiplicity in solutions, these problems were proposed to be solved suitably using evolutionary algorithms using a population approach in its search procedure. Starting with parameterised procedures in early 90s, the so-called evolutionary multi-objective optimisation ({EMO}) algorithms is now an established field of research and application with many dedicated texts and edited books, commercial softwares and numerous freely downloadable codes, a biannual conference series running successfully since 2001, special sessions and workshops held at all major evolutionary computing conferences, and full-time researchers from universities and industries from all around the globe.

Results indicate that nearly every cyclone present in {IBTrACS} over the period 1979–2012 can be found in all six reanalyses using a tracking and matching approach. However, {TC} intensities are significantly underrepresented in the reanalyses compared to the observations. Applying a typical objective {TC} identification scheme, it is found that the largest uncertainties in {TC} identification occur for the weaker storms; this is exacerbated by uncertainties in the observations for weak storms and lack of consistency in operational procedures. For example, certain types of storms, such as tropical depressions, subtropical cyclones, and monsoon depressions, are not included in the best-track data for all reporting agencies. There are definite improvements in how well {TCs} are represented in more recent, higher-resolution reanalyses; in particular {MERRA}-2 is comparable with the {NCEP}-{CFSR} and {JRA}-55 reanalyses, which perform significantly better than the older {MERRA} reanalysis.},

Version 2.1 of the {TE} framework now provides extensive support for examining both nodal (i.e., pointwise) and areal features, including tropical and extratropical cyclones, monsoonal lows and depressions, atmospheric rivers, atmospheric blocking, precipitation clusters, and heat waves. Available operations include nodal and areal thresholding, calculations of quantities related to nodal features such as accumulated cyclone energy and azimuthal wind profiles, filtering data based on the characteristics of nodal features, and stereographic compositing. This paper describes the core algorithms (kernels) that have been added to the {TE} framework since version 1.0, including algorithms for editing pointwise trajectory files, composition of fields around nodal features, generation of areal masks via thresholding and nodal features, and tracking of areal features in time. Several examples are provided of how these kernels can be combined to produce composite algorithms for evaluating and understanding common atmospheric features and their underlying processes. These examples include analyzing the fraction of precipitation from tropical cyclones, compositing meteorological fields around extratropical cyclones, calculating fractional contribution to poleward vapor transport from atmospheric rivers, and building a climatology of atmospheric blocks.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Abstract A novel approach to tropical cyclone ({TC}) detection in coarse-resolution numerical model data is introduced and assessed. This approach differs from traditional detectors in two main ways. First, it was developed and tuned using 20 yr of {ECMWF} Interim Re-Analysis ({ERA}-Interim) data, rather than using climate model data. This ensures that the detector is independent of any climate models to which it will later be applied. Second, only relatively large-scale parameters resolvable in climate models are included, in order to minimize any grid-resolution dependence on parameter thresholds. This approach is taken in an attempt to construct a unified {TC} detection procedure applicable to all climate models without the need for any further tuning or adjustment. Unlike traditional detectors that seek to identify {TCs} directly, the authors' method seeks to identify conditions favorable for {TC} formation. Favorable {TC} formation regions at the center of closed circulations in the lower troposphere to the midtroposphere are identified using a low-deformation vorticity parameter. Additional relative and specific humidity thresholds are applied to ensure the thermodynamic environment is favorable, and a vertical wind shear threshold is applied to eliminate storms in a destructive shear environment. A further requirement is that thresholds for all parameters must be satisfied for at least 48 h before a {TC} is deemed to have developed. A thorough assessment of the detector performance is provided. It is demonstrated that the method reproduces realistic {TC} genesis frequency and spatial distributions in the {ERA}-Interim data. Application of the detector to four climate models is presented in a companion paper.},

	abstract = {Abstract The warm-core structure of tropical cyclones is examined in idealized simulations using the Weather Research and Forecasting ({WRF}) Model. The maximum perturbation temperature in a control simulation occurs in the midtroposphere (5–6 km), in contrast to the upper-tropospheric ({\textgreater}10 km) warm core that is widely believed to be typical. This conventional view is reassessed and found to be largely based on three case studies, and it is argued that the “typical” warm-core structure is actually not well known. In the control simulation, the height of the warm core is nearly constant over a wide range of intensities. From additional simulations in which either the size of the initial vortex or the microphysics parameterization is varied, it is shown that the warm core is generally found at 4–8 km. A secondary maximum often develops near 13–14 km but is almost always weaker than the primary warm core. It is demonstrated that microwave remote sensing instruments are of insufficient resolution to detect this midlevel warm core, and the conclusions of some studies that have utilized these instruments may not be reliable. Using simple arguments based on thermal wind balance, it is shown that the height of the warm core is not necessarily related to either the height where the vertical shear of the tangential winds is maximized or the height where the radial temperature gradient is maximized. In particular, changes in the height of the warm core need not imply changes in either the intensity of the storm or in the manner in which the winds in the eyewall decay with height.},

On the other hand, the {CISK} hypothesis, in the form originally advanced by Charney and Eliassen, holds that initial development results from the organized release of preexisting conditional instability. In this series of papers, we explore the relative importance of ambient conditional instability and air-sea latent and sensible heat transfer in both the development and maintenance of tropical cyclones using highly idealized models. In particular, we advance the hypothesis that the intensification and maintenance of tropical cyclones depend exclusively on self-induced heat transfer from the ocean. In this sense, these storms may be regarded as resulting from a finite amplitude air-sea interaction instability rather than from a linear instability involving ambient potential buoyancy. In the present paper, we attempt to show that reasonably intense cyclones may be maintained in a steady state without conditional instability of ambient air. In Part {II} we will demonstrate that weak but finite-amplitude axisymmetric disturbances may intensify in a conditionally neutral environment.},

Here we provide theoretical grounding for this relationship. We first demonstrate that the central pressure deficit is highly predictable from the low-level wind field via gradient wind balance. We then show that this relationship reduces to a dependence on two velocity scales: the maximum azimuthal-mean azimuthal wind speed and half the product of the Coriolis parameter and outer storm size. This simple theory is found to hold across a hierarchy of models spanning reduced-complexity and Earth-like global simulations and observations. Thus, the central pressure deficit is an intensity measure that combines maximum wind speed, storm size, and background rotation rate. This work has significant implications for both fundamental understanding and risk analysis, including why the central pressure better explains historical economic damages than does maximum wind speed.},

Comparing the climatologies between {IBTrACS}-{WMO} and {NHC}+{JTWC} highlights some of the heterogeneities inherent in these datasets for the period of global satellite coverage 1981–2010. The results demonstrate the sensitivity of these climatologies to the choice of best track dataset. Previous studies have examined best track heterogeneities in individual regions, usually the North Atlantic and west Pacific. This study puts those regional issues into their global context. The differences between {NHC}+{JTWC} and {IBTrACS}-{WMO} are greatest in the west Pacific, where the strongest storms are substantially weaker in {IBTrACS}-{WMO}. These disparities strongly affect the global measures of tropical cyclone activity because 30\% of the world’s tropical cyclones form in the west Pacific. Because {JTWC} employs similar procedures throughout most of the globe, the comparisons in this study highlight differences between {WMO} agencies. For example, {NHC}+{JTWC} has more 96-kt ({\textasciitilde}49 m s−1) storms than {IBTrACS}-{WMO} in the west Pacific but fewer in the Australian region. This discrepancy probably points to differing operational procedures between the {WMO} agencies in the two regions. Without better documentation of historical analysis procedures, the only way to remedy these heterogeneities will be through systematic reanalysis.},

	abstract = {Abstract The following study examines the position and intensity differences of tropical cyclones ({TCs}) among the Best-Track and five atmospheric reanalysis datasets to evaluate the degree to which reanalyses are appropriate for studying {TCs}. While significant differences are found in both reanalysis {TC} intensity and position, the representation of {TC} intensity within reanalyses is found to be most problematic owing to its underestimation beyond what can be attributed solely to the coarse grid resolution. Moreover, the mean life cycle of normalized {TC} intensity within reanalyses reveals an underestimation of both prepeak intensification rates as well as a delay in peak intensity relative to the Best-Track. These discrepancies between Best-Track and reanalysis {TC} intensity and position can further be described through correlations with such parameters as Best-Track {TC} age, Best-Track {TC} intensity, Best-Track {TC} location, and the extended Best-Track {TC} size. Specifically, {TC} position differences within the 40-yr European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ({ECMWF}) Re-Analysis ({ERA}-40), {ECMWF} Interim Re-Analysis ({ERA}-I), and Modern Era Retrospective-Analysis for Research and Applications ({MERRA}) exhibit statistically significant correlations (0.27 ≤ R ≤ 0.38) with the proximity of {TCs} to observation dense areas in the North Atlantic ({NATL}) and western North Pacific ({WPAC}). Reanalysis {TC} intensity is found to be most strongly correlated with Best-Track {TC} size (0.53 ≤ R ≤ 0.70 for maximum 10-m wind speed; −0.71 ≤ R ≤ −0.53 for minimum mean sea level pressure) while exhibiting smaller, yet significant, correlations with Best-Track {TC} age, Best-Track {TC} intensity, and Best-Track {TC} latitude. Of the three basins examined, the eastern North Pacific ({EPAC}) has the largest reanalysis {TC} position differences and weakest intensities possibly due to a relative dearth of observations, the strong nearby terrain gradient, and the movement of {TCs} away from the most observation dense portion of the basin over time. The smaller mean Best-Track size and shorter mean lifespan of Best-Track {EPAC} {TCs} may also yield weaker reanalysis {TC} intensities. Of the five reanalyses, the smaller position differences and stronger intensities found in the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis ({CFSR}) and Japanese 25-year Reanalysis ({JRA}-25) are attributed to the use of vortex relocation and {TC} wind profile retrievals, respectively. The discrepancies in {TC} position between the Best-Track and reanalyses combined with the muted magnitude of {TC} intensity and its partially nonphysical life cycle within reanalyses suggests that caution should be exercised when utilizing these datasets for studies that rely either on {TC} intensity (raw or normalized) or track. Finally, several cases of nonphysical {TC} structure also argue that further work is needed to improve {TC} representation while implying that studies focusing solely on {TC} intensity and track do not necessarily extend to other aspects of {TC} representation.},

	abstract = {The Japan Meteorological Agency ({JMA}) conducted the second Japanese global atmospheric reanalysis, called the Japanese 55-year Reanalysis or {JRA}-55. It covers the period from 1958, when regular radiosonde observations began on a global basis. {JRA}-55 is the first comprehensive reanalysis that has covered the last half-century since the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts 45-year Reanalysis ({ERA}-40), and is the first one to apply four-dimensional variational analysis to this period. The main objectives of {JRA}-55 were to address issues found in previous reanalyses and to produce a comprehensive atmospheric dataset suitable for studying multidecadal variability and climate change. This paper describes the observations, data assimilation system, and forecast model used to produce {JRA}-55 as well as the basic characteristics of the {JRA}-55 product. {JRA}-55 has been produced with the {TL}319 version of {JMA}’s operational data assimilation system as of December 2009, which was extensively improved since the Japanese 25-year Reanalysis ({JRA}-25). It also uses several newly available and improved past observations. The resulting reanalysis products are considerably better than the {JRA}-25 product. Two major problems of {JRA}-25 were a cold bias in the lower stratosphere, which has been diminished, and a dry bias in the Amazon basin, which has been mitigated. The temporal consistency of temperature analysis has also been considerably improved compared to previous reanalysis products. Our initial quality evaluation revealed problems such as a warm bias in the upper troposphere, large upward imbalance in the global mean net energy fluxes at the top of the atmosphere and at the surface, excessive precipitation over the tropics, and unrealistic trends in analyzed tropical cyclone strength. This paper also assesses the impacts of model biases and changes in the observing system, and mentions efforts to further investigate the representation of low-frequency variability and trends in {JRA}-55.},

	abstract = {Abstract The second version of the {NCEP} Climate Forecast System ({CFSv}2) was made operational at {NCEP} in March 2011. This version has upgrades to nearly all aspects of the data assimilation and forecast model components of the system. A coupled reanalysis was made over a 32-yr period (1979–2010), which provided the initial conditions to carry out a comprehensive reforecast over 29 years (1982–2010). This was done to obtain consistent and stable calibrations, as well as skill estimates for the operational subseasonal and seasonal predictions at {NCEP} with {CFSv}2. The operational implementation of the full system ensures a continuity of the climate record and provides a valuable up-to-date dataset to study many aspects of predictability on the seasonal and subseasonal scales. Evaluation of the reforecasts show that the {CFSv}2 increases the length of skillful {MJO} forecasts from 6 to 17 days (dramatically improving subseasonal forecasts), nearly doubles the skill of seasonal forecasts of 2-m temperatures over the United States, and significantly improves global {SST} forecasts over its predecessor. The {CFSv}2 not only provides greatly improved guidance at these time scales but also creates many more products for subseasonal and seasonal forecasting with an extensive set of retrospective forecasts for users to calibrate their forecast products. These retrospective and real-time operational forecasts will be used by a wide community of users in their decision making processes in areas such as water management for rivers and agriculture, transportation, energy use by utilities, wind and other sustainable energy, and seasonal prediction of the hurricane season.},

However, investigations into tropical cyclone ({TC}) structures are lacking. This study examines position, intensity, and structure of U.S. landfalling {TCs} in these data sets during 1998–2012. {TC} positions are determined using three dynamic and thermodynamic parameters. In {NARR}, positions are problematic near the domain boundary but show statistically significant improvements compared with {CFSR} in regions over the U.S. and near its coastlines. {TC} intensity is universally underestimated in both data sets, yet the pressure-wind relationship is reasonably maintained. {NARR} and {CFSR} intensities are highly correlated (r = 0.93), suggesting that these data sets are limited in a similar fashion in their generation of intensity and that advanced data assimilation techniques are unable to overcome the shortcomings of low resolutions. To investigate {TC} structure, a 10-storm composite is constructed using the most intense model {TCs} at peak intensity. Both models develop robust warm cores (T′ 6–7 K), but the radius of maximum winds ({\textgreater}100 km) is too broad compared with storms in nature. Secondary circulation features in {NARR} are more realistic, particularly the shallow inflow layer, vertical motion in the inner core, and confined outflow in the upper troposphere. Results indicate that, over the U.S. and near its coastline, {NARR} positions and structure are competitive with or slightly improved upon {CFSR}. Away from the domain boundary, {NARR} is a suitable resource for evaluating {TC} positions and certain aspects of the secondary circulation.},

This balance prevails only for the azimuthal mean, not locally, nor is balance to be expected in either the surface friction layer or the upper tropospheric outflow layer where the radial flow is comparable with the swirling flow. It is theoretically possible that axisymmetric supergradient flow may occur in response to rapid radial acceleration where the radial flow slows in the friction layer beneath the eyewall or where it converges into intense diabatically forced updrafts. Nevertheless, the observations in the free lower and midtroposphere show that systematic departures of the azimuthal mean vortex from balance are too small to measure.},

	abstract = {Abstract The recent development of the global positioning system ({GPS}) dropwindsonde has allowed the wind and thermodynamic structure of the hurricane eyewall to be documented with unprecedented accuracy and resolution. In an attempt to assist operational hurricane forecasters in their duties, dropwindsonde data have been used in this study to document, for the first time, the mean vertical profile of wind speed in the hurricane inner core from the surface to the 700-{hPa} level, the level typically flown by reconnaissance aircraft. The dropwindsonde-derived mean eyewall wind profile is characterized by a broad maximum centered 500 m above the surface. In the frictional boundary layer below this broad maximum, the wind decreases nearly linearly with the logarithm of the altitude. Above the maximum, the winds decrease because of the hurricane's warm core. These two effects combine to give a surface wind that is, on average, about 90\% of the 700-{hPa} value. The dropwindsonde observations largely confirm recent operational practices at the National Hurricane Center for the interpretation of flight-level data. Hurricane wind profiles outside of the eyewall region are characterized by a higher level of maximum wind, near 1 km, and a more constant wind speed between 700 {hPa} and the top of the boundary layer. Two factors that likely affect the eyewall profile structure are wind speed and vertical motion. A minimum in surface wind adjustment factor (i.e., relatively low surface wind speeds) was found when the wind near the top of the boundary layer was between 40 and 60 m s−1. At higher wind speeds, the fraction of the boundary layer wind speed found at the surface increased, contrary to expectation. Low-level downdrafts, and enhanced vertical motion generally, were also associated with higher relative surface winds. These results may be of interest to engineers concerned with building codes, to emergency managers who may be tempted to use high-rise buildings as a “refuge of last resort” in coastal areas, and to those people on locally elevated terrain. The top of a 25-story coastal high-rise in the hurricane eyewall will experience a mean wind that is about 17\% higher (or one Saffir–Simpson hurricane-scale category) than the surface or advisory value. For this reason, residents who must take refuge in coastal high-rises should generally do so at the lowest levels necessary to avoid storm surge.},

Apparent eye warming extends upward to upper troposphere and downward to near surface after tropical storm formation. {TC} intensity shows a robust positive correlation with the warm core strength and has a weaker but still significant positive correlation with the warm core height (the weaker correlation is primarily attributed to the scattered warm core heights of weak {TCs}).

Structural metrics developed from observational composites are used in the model evaluation process. The results show improvements in track and intensity forecasts in response to the improvement of the vertical diffusion. The results also demonstrate substantial improvements in the simulated storm size, surface inflow angle, near-surface wind profile, and kinematic boundary layer heights in simulations with the improved physics, while only minor improvements are found in the thermodynamic boundary layer height, eyewall slope, and the distributions of vertical velocities in the eyewall. Other structural metrics such as warm core anomaly and warm core height are also explored. Reasons for the structural differences between the two sets of forecasts with different physics are discussed. This work further emphasizes the importance of aircraft observations in model diagnostics and development, endorsing a developmental framework for improving physical parameterizations in hurricane models.},

	abstract = {Abstract In this study, it is shown that the maximum tangential winds within tropical cyclones decrease with height at a percentage rate that is nearly independent of both the maximum wind speed and the radius of maximum winds ({RMW}). This can be seen by normalizing the profiles of maximum tangential winds Vmax by their respective values at 2-km height. From Doppler radar analyses, profiles of maximum normalized tangential wind Vmaxnorm are found to share a common shape, despite spanning a great range of intensities. There is a systematic dependence of Vmaxnorm on intensity and size, but it is shown to be small, and the mean profile of Vmaxnorm can be used to accurately “predict” the individual profiles of Vmax. Using Emanuel’s steady-state analytical vortex model, it is shown that Vmaxnorm is essentially independent of the size of the {RMW}. It is shown mathematically that the near independence of Vmaxnorm from size is due to the facts that the {RMW} is nearly a surface of constant absolute angular momentum M and that its outward slope increases linearly with radius. As the slope of the {RMW} is not a function of intensity, Vmaxnorm is also nearly independent of intensity in theory, and this is confirmed using Emanuel’s simple time-dependent model. In contrast to intensity, it is shown that Vmaxnorm increases with potential intensity. A suite of idealized simulations using the Weather Research and Forecasting model ({WRF}) are used to further examine the manner in which the maximum winds change with height. Above 2-km height, vertical profiles of Vmaxnorm are nearly independent of both intensity and size. Occasional deviations from this near-universal profile in these simulations are due to unbalanced winds, and it is proposed that this is the cause of occasional observations of maximum winds that are nearly constant with height through the midtroposphere, as in Hurricane Gloria (1985) and Hurricane Dennis (2005).},

Most of the reanalyses reproduce a reasonable global spatial distribution of observed {TCs} and temporal interannual variation of total {TC} frequency. Of the six reanalysis data sets, {JRA}-55 appears to be the best in terms of the following: the highest skill for spatial and temporal distribution of {TC} frequency of occurrence, highest {TC} hitting rate, lower false alarm rate, reasonable {TC} structure in terms of the relationship between maximum surface wind speed and sea level pressure, and higher correlation coefficients for interannual variations of {TC} frequency. These results also suggest that the finest-resolution reanalysis data sets, like {MERRA}, are not always the best in terms of {TC} climatology.},

	abstract = {Several global quantities are computed from the {ERA}40 reanalysis for the period 1958–2001 and explored for trends. These are discussed in the context of changes to the global observing system. Temperature, integrated water vapor ({IWV}), and kinetic energy are considered. The {ERA}40 global mean temperature in the lower troposphere has a trend of +0.11 K per decade over the period of 1979–2001, which is slightly higher than the {MSU} measurements, but within the estimated error limit. For the period 1958–2001 the warming trend is 0.14 K per decade but this is likely to be an artifact of changes in the observing system. When this is corrected for, the warming trend is reduced to 0.10 K per decade. The global trend in {IWV} for the period 1979–2001 is +0.36 mm per decade. This is about twice as high as the trend determined from the Clausius-Clapeyron relation assuming conservation of relative humidity. It is also larger than results from free climate model integrations driven by the same observed sea surface temperature as used in {ERA}40. It is suggested that the large trend in {IWV} does not represent a genuine climate trend but an artifact caused by changes in the global observing system such as the use of {SSM}/I and more satellite soundings in later years. Recent results are in good agreement with {GPS} measurements. The {IWV} trend for the period 1958–2001 is still higher but reduced to +0.16 mm per decade when corrected for changes in the observing systems. Total kinetic energy shows an increasing global trend. Results from data assimilation experiments strongly suggest that this trend is also incorrect and mainly caused by the huge changes in the global observing system in 1979. When this is corrected for, no significant change in global kinetic energy from 1958 onward can be found.},

While the {MSU} and {NCEP}–{NCAR} temperatures show fairly good agreement overall, large discrepancies with {ECMWF} temperatures indicate that changes in the satellite observing system may have adversely affected the {ECMWF} reanalyses, especially in the Tropics. Two spurious discontinuities are present in tropical temperatures with jumps to warmer values throughout the Tropics below 500 mb in late 1986 and early 1989, and further spurious interannual variability is also present. These features are also reflected in the specific humidity fields. The temperature discrepancies have a complex vertical structure with height that is not fully understood, although it seems that the problems partly arise from positive reinforcement of biases in satellite radiances with those of the assimilating model first guess. Changes in the observing system provide a limit to the usefulness of the reanalyses in some climate studies.},

	abstract = {The {NCEP} and {NCAR} are cooperating in a project (denoted “reanalysis”) to produce a 40-year record of global analyses of atmospheric fields in support of the needs of the research and climate monitoring communities. This effort involves the recovery of land surface, ship, rawinsonde, pibal, aircraft, satellite, and other data; quality controlling and assimilating these data with a data assimilation system that is kept unchanged over the reanalysis period 1957–96. This eliminates perceived climate jumps associated with changes in the data assimilation system. The {NCEP}/{NCAR} 40-yr reanalysis uses a frozen state-of-the-art global data assimilation system and a database as complete as possible. The data assimilation and the model used are identical to the global system implemented operationally at the {NCEP} on 11 January 1995, except that the horizontal resolution is T62 (about 210 km). The database has been enhanced with many sources of observations not available in real time for operations, provided by different countries and organizations. The system has been designed with advanced quality control and monitoring components, and can produce 1 mon of reanalysis per day on a Cray {YMP}/8 supercomputer. Different types of output archives are being created to satisfy different user needs, including a “quick look” {CD}-{ROM} (one per year) with six tropospheric and stratospheric fields available twice daily, as well as surface, top-of-the-atmosphere, and isentropic fields. Reanalysis information and selected output is also available on-line via the Internet (http//:nic.fb4.noaa.gov:8000). A special {CDROM}, containing 13 years of selected observed, daily, monthly, and climatological data from the {NCEP}/{NCAR} Reanalysis, is included with this issue. Output variables are classified into four classes, depending on the degree to which they are influenced by the observations and/or the model. For example, “C” variables (such as precipitation and surface fluxes) are completely determined by the model during the data assimilation and should be used with caution. Nevertheless, a comparison of these variables with observations and with several climatologies shows that they generally contain considerable useful information. Eight-day forecasts, produced every 5 days, should be useful for predictability studies and for monitoring the quality of the observing systems. The 40 years of reanalysis (1957–96) should be completed in early 1997. A continuation into the future through an identical Climate Data Assimilation System will allow researchers to reliably compare recent anomalies with those in earlier decades. Since changes in the observing systems will inevitably produce perceived changes in the climate, parallel reanalyses (at least 1 year long) will be generated for the periods immediately after the introduction of new observing systems, such as new types of satellite data. {NCEP} plans currently call for an updated reanalysis using a state-of-the-art system every five years or so. The successive reanalyses will be greatly facilitated by the generation of the comprehensive database in the present reanalysis.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong class="journal-{contentHeaderColor}"{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} Reanalysis near-surface wind fields from multiple reanalyses are potentially an important information source for wind energy applications. Inter-comparing reanalyses via employing independent observations can help to guide users to useful spatio-temporal scales. Here we compare the statistical properties of wind speeds observed at 210 traditional meteorological stations over Germany with the reanalyses' near-surface fields, confining the analysis to the recent years (2007 to 2010). In this period, the station time series in Germany can be expected to be mostly homogeneous. We compare with a regional reanalysis ({COSMO}-{REA}6) and two global reanalyses, {ERA}-Interim and {ERA}-20C. We show that for the majority of the stations, the Weibull parameters of the daily mean wind speed frequency distribution match remarkably well with the ones derived from the reanalysis fields. High correlations (larger than 0.9) can be found between stations and reanalysis monthly mean wind speeds all over Germany. Generally, the correlation between the higher resolved {COSMO}-{REA}6 wind fields and station observations is highest, for both assimilated and non-assimilated (i.e., independent) observations. As expected from the lower spatial resolution and reduced amount of data assimilated into {ERA}-20C, the correlation of monthly means decreases somewhat relative to the other reanalyses (in our investigated period of 2007 to 2010). Still, the inter-annual variability connected to the North Atlantic Oscillation ({NAO}) found in the reanalysis surface wind anomalies is in accordance with the anomalies recorded by the stations. We discuss some typical examples where differences are found, e.g., where the mean wind distributions differ (probably related to either height or model topography differences) and where the correlations break down (because of unresolved local topography) which applies to a minority of stations. We also identified stations with homogeneity problems in the reported station values, demonstrating how reanalyses can be applied to support quality control for the observed station data. Finally, as a demonstration of concept, we discuss how comparing feedback files of the different reanalyses can guide users to useful scales of variability.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We base our analysis on the ratio of ice condensates to the total condensates (phase ratio, {PR}). Its transition at 90\% ({PR}90) and its links with other relevant variables are evaluated using the {GCM}-Oriented Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation Cloud Product climatology, reanalysis data, and other satellite observations. In 13 of 16 models, the {PR}90 transition height occurs too low (6 km to 8.4 km) and at temperatures too warm (−13.9°C to −32.5°C) compared to observations (8.6 km, −33.7°C); features consistent with a lack of supercooled liquid with respect to ice above 6.5 km. However, this bias would be slightly reduced by using the lidar simulator. In convective regimes (more humid air and precipitation), the observed cloud phase transition occurs at a warmer temperature than for subsidence regimes (less humid air and precipitation). Only few models manage to roughly replicate the observed correlations with humidity (5/16), vertical velocity (5/16), and precipitation (4/16); 3/16 perform well for all these parameters ({MPI}-{ESM}, {NCAR}-{CAM}5, and {NCHU}). Using an observation-based Clausius-Clapeyron phase diagram, we illustrate that the Bergeron-Findeisen process is a necessary condition for models to represent the observed features. Finally, the best models are those that include more complex microphysics.},

The paper provides a description of each component of {CNRM}-{CM}6-1, including the coupling method and the new online output software. We emphasize where model's components have been updated with respect to the former model version, {CNRM}-{CM}5.1.

A particular attention has also been devoted to mass and energy conservation in the simulated climate system to limit long-term drifts. The climate simulated by {CNRM}-{CM}6-1 is then evaluated using {CMIP}6 historical and Diagnostic, Evaluation and Characterization of Klima ({DECK}) experiments in comparison with {CMIP}5 {CNRM}-{CM}5.1 equivalent experiments. Overall, the mean surface biases are of similar magnitude but with different spatial patterns. Deep ocean biases are generally reduced, whereas sea ice is too thin in the Arctic. Although the simulated climate variability remains roughly consistent with {CNRM}-{CM}5.1, its sensitivity to rising {CO}2 has increased: the equilibrium climate sensitivity is 4.9 K, which is now close to the upper bound of the range estimated from {CMIP}5 models.},

The approach is motivated, described, and applied to available Coupled Model Intercomparison Project ({CMIP}) archives and the Community Earth System Model ({CESM}) Version 1 Large Ensemble archives with the goal of robustly benchmarking model performance and its evolution across {CMIP} generations. A scoring system is employed that minimizes sensitivity to internal variability, external forcings, and model tuning. Scores are based on pattern correlations of the simulated mean state, seasonal contrasts, and {ENSO} teleconnections. A broad range of feedback-relevant fields is considered and summarized on discrete timescales (climatology, seasonal, interannual) and physical realms (energy budget, water cycle, dynamics). Fields are also generally chosen for which observational uncertainty is small compared to model structural differences.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Highest mean variable scores across models are reported for well-observed fields such as sea level pressure, precipitable water, and outgoing longwave radiation, while the lowest scores are reported for 500\&thinsp;{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}{hPa}{\textless}/span{\textgreater} vertical velocity, net surface energy flux, and precipitation minus evaporation.

	abstract = {Tropical cyclones have been investigated in a T159 version of the {MPI} {ECHAM}5 climate model using a novel technique to diagnose the evolution of the three-dimensional vorticity structure of tropical cyclones, including their full life cycle from weak initial vortices to their possible extra-tropical transition. Results have been compared with re-analyses [the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ({ECMWF}) 40-yr Re-analysis ({ERA}40) and Japanese 25 yr re-analysis ({JRA}25)] and observed tropical storms during the period 1978–1999 for the Northern Hemisphere. There is no indication of any trend in the number or intensity of tropical storms during this period in {ECHAM}5 or in re-analyses but there are distinct inter-annual variations. The storms simulated by {ECHAM}5 are realistic both in space and time, but the model and even more so the re-analyses, underestimate the intensities of the most intense storms (in terms of their maximum wind speeds). There is an indication of a response to El Ni˜no-Southern Oscillation ({ENSO}) with a smaller number of Atlantic storms during El Ni˜no in agreement with previous studies.The global divergence circulation responds to El Ni˜no by setting up a large-scale convergence flow, with the centre over the central Pacific with enhanced subsidence over the tropical Atlantic. At the same time there is an increase in the vertical wind shear in the region of the tropical Atlantic where tropical storms normally develop. There is a good correspondence between the model and {ERA}40 except that the divergence circulation is somewhat stronger in the model. The model underestimates storms in the Atlantic but tends to overestimate them in {theWestern} Pacific and in the North Indian Ocean.It is suggested that the overestimation of storms in the Pacific by the model is related to an overly strong response to the tropical Pacific sea surface temperature ({SST}) anomalies. The overestimation in the North Indian Ocean is likely to be due to an over prediction in the intensity of monsoon depressions, which are then classified as intense tropical storms. Nevertheless, overall results are encouraging and will further contribute to increased confidence in simulating intense tropical storms with high-resolution climate models.},

The following study is aimed at highlighting the effects of strong Tropical Cyclones over the Tropical Atlantic on the mean climate. Their composite effect on the surface winds is made apparent by a wide cyclonic perturbation that affects a large portion of the Atlantic tropical Ocean. Teleconnection patterns, which are visible in the Sea Level Pressure anomalies associated with this Tropical Composite Cyclone, appear to link the activity of the hurricanes to the Arctic Ocean. A significant negative correlation between the energy dissipated by hurricanes in the Tropical atmosphere and the sea ice cover along the Transpolar Drift Stream path, has also been found.},

	abstract = {Abstract In this paper the interplay between tropical cyclones ({TCs}) and the Northern Hemispheric ocean heat transport ({OHT}) is investigated. In particular, results from a numerical simulation of the twentieth-century and twenty-first-century climates, following the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ({IPCC}) twentieth-century run (20C3M) and A1B scenario protocols, respectively, have been analyzed. The numerical simulations have been performed using a state-of-the-art global atmosphere–ocean–sea ice coupled general circulation model ({CGCM}) with relatively high-resolution (T159) in the atmosphere. The {CGCM} skill in reproducing a realistic {TC} climatology has been assessed by comparing the model results from the simulation of the twentieth century with available observations. The model simulates tropical cyclone–like vortices with many features similar to the observed {TCs}. Specifically, the simulated {TCs} exhibit realistic structure, geographical distribution, and interannual variability, indicating that the model is able to capture the basic mechanisms linking the {TC} activity with the large-scale circulation. The cooling of the surface ocean observed in correspondence of the {TCs} is well simulated by the model. {TC} activity is shown to significantly increase the poleward {OHT} out of the tropics and decrease the poleward {OHT} from the deep tropics on short time scales. This effect, investigated by looking at the 100 most intense Northern Hemisphere {TCs}, is strongly correlated with the {TC}-induced momentum flux at the ocean surface, where the winds associated with the {TCs} significantly weaken (strengthen) the trade winds in the 5°–18°N (18°–30°N) latitude belt. However, the induced perturbation does not impact the yearly averaged {OHT}. The frequency and intensity of the {TCs} appear to be substantially stationary through the entire 1950–2069 simulated period, as does the effect of the {TCs} on the {OHT}.},

	abstract = {Tropical cyclones are known to mix the upper layers of the ocean, a process that 'pumps' heat downwards and thereby cools the ocean surface on local scales. It has been suggested that they may play an important role in ocean mixing at the global scale, and new calculations suggest that tropical cyclones are indeed responsible for significant cooling and vertical mixing of the surface ocean in tropical regions. Heat pumped downwards must be balanced by heat transport towards the poles, so some 15\% of peak poleward oceanic heat transport may be associated with tropical cyclone-induced mixing. The amount of mixing induced by tropical cyclones is also related to sea surface temperature, suggesting that future changes in tropical sea surface temperatures may have significant effects on ocean circulation and ocean heat transport, as both processes are affected by ocean mixing. Climate change models could benefit from taking these effects into account. See also last week's Concepts essay, in which Martin Visbeck argues that the 'pulling power' of upwardly mobile ocean waters is an increasing factor in ocean mixing. Elsewhere in this issue, Quirin Schiermeier takes a broad view of recent work on ocean mixing and the {US} National Hurricane Center releases its latest storm predictions.},

	abstract = {Abstract The Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 ({MERRA}-2), is the latest atmospheric reanalysis of the modern satellite era produced by {NASA}’s Global Modeling and Assimilation Office ({GMAO}). {MERRA}-2 assimilates observation types not available to its predecessor, {MERRA}, and includes updates to the Goddard Earth Observing System ({GEOS}) model and analysis scheme so as to provide a viable ongoing climate analysis beyond {MERRA}’s terminus. While addressing known limitations of {MERRA}, {MERRA}-2 is also intended to be a development milestone for a future integrated Earth system analysis ({IESA}) currently under development at {GMAO}. This paper provides an overview of the {MERRA}-2 system and various performance metrics. Among the advances in {MERRA}-2 relevant to {IESA} are the assimilation of aerosol observations, several improvements to the representation of the stratosphere including ozone, and improved representations of cryospheric processes. Other improvements in the quality of {MERRA}-2 compared with {MERRA} include the reduction of some spurious trends and jumps related to changes in the observing system and reduced biases and imbalances in aspects of the water cycle. Remaining deficiencies are also identified. Production of {MERRA}-2 began in June 2014 in four processing streams and converged to a single near-real-time stream in mid-2015. {MERRA}-2 products are accessible online through the {NASA} Goddard Earth Sciences Data Information Services Center ({GES} {DISC}).},

	abstract = {A long-term global atmospheric reanalysis, named “Japanese 25-year Reanalysis ({JRA}-25)” was completed using the Japan Meteorological Agency ({JMA}) numerical assimilation and forecast system. The analysis covers the period from 1979 to 2004. This is the first long-term reanalysis undertaken in Asia. {JMA}'s latest numerical assimilation system, and specially collected observational data, were used to generate a consistent and high-quality reanalysis dataset designed for climate research and operational monitoring and forecasts. One of the many purposes of {JRA}-25 is to enhance the analysis to a high quality in the Asian region.Six-hourly data assimilation cycles were performed, producing 6-hourly atmospheric analysis and forecast fields of various physical variables. The global model used in {JRA}-25 has a spectral resolution of T106 (equivalent to a horizontal grid size of around 120 km) and 40 vertical layers with the top level at 0.4 {hPa}. In addition to conventional surface and upper air observations, atmospheric motion vector ({AMV}) wind retrieved from geostationary satellites, brightness temperature from {TIROS} Operational Vertical Sounder ({TOVS}), precipitable water retrieved from orbital satellite microwave radiometer radiance and other satellite data are assimilated with three-dimensional variational method (3D-Var). {JMA} produced daily sea surface temperature ({SST}), sea ice and three-dimensional ozone profiles for {JRA}-25. A new quality control method for {TOVS} data was developed and applied in advance.Many advantages have been found in the {JRA}-25 reanalysis. Predicted 6-hour global total precipitation distribution and amount are well reproduced both in space and time. The performance of the long time series of the global precipitation is the best among the other reanalyses, with few unrealistic variations from degraded satellite data contaminated by volcanic eruptions. Secondly, {JRA}-25 is the first reanalysis to assimilate wind profiles around tropical cyclones reconstructed from historical best track information; tropical cyclones were analyzed properly in all the global regions. Additionally, low-level cloud along the subtropical western coast of continents is well simulated and snow depth analysis is also of a good quality. The article also covers material which requires attention when using {JRA}-25.},

Many of the deficiencies found in the first Japanese reanalysis, the Japanese 25-year Reanalysis ({JRA}-25), have been improved. It aims at providing a comprehensive atmospheric dataset that is suitable for studies of climate change or multi-decadal variability, by producing a more time-consistent dataset for a longer period than {JRA}-25.Production of {JRA}-55 started in 2010, and computations for more than 16 years have been completed as of August 2011.

	abstract = {A new long-term reanalysis project, {JRA}-25, has set as one of its main goals the realistic representation of tropical cyclones ({TCs}) in the reanalysis. To supplement in situ observations near {TCs}, wind profile data ({TCR} data) are retrieved based on best track information and assimilated. This paper addresses the benefits of using {TCR} data for the analysis of {TCs}.{TC} representation in the {JRA}-25 reanalysis is compared with other reanalysis data, and an experimental reanalysis (Control) without {TCR} data. The general result is that {JRA}-25 successfu11y represents the location and intensity of each {TC}. Among {TC} basins in the Northern Hemisphere, the {TC} representation in the {JRA}-25 data in the eastern North Pacific, and in the tropical Atlantic, where upper observations are sparse, is superior compared to other datasets that did not assimilate {TCR} data. In the western North Pacific, especially around Japan and the East China Sea, {TCR} data give little improvement in {TC} representation, since conventional upper observations are dense there and upstream of the active {TCregtons}.{TC} detection rates in the Northern basins and over the entire globe, are computed using an objective procedure from the reanalysis datasets. The rate in {JRA}-25 is the highest in all basins among the datasets, and consistent through the period. The high qualified {TC} representation in intensity and location has a positive effect on a flow field, and hydrologic cycle around {TCs}. Case studies of {TC} track forecasts for a recurving {TC}, in which reanalysis data are used as initial conditions, suggest the {JRA}-25 data are more realistic than the Control. For these reasons, {TCR} data is effective in representing {TCs} and sur rounding atmospheric conditions in {JRA}-25.},

	abstract = {{ERA}-40 is a re-analysis of meteorological observations from September 1957 to August 2002 produced by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ({ECMWF}) in collaboration with many institutions. The observing system changed considerably over this re-analysis period, with assimilable data provided by a succession of satellite-borne instruments from the 1970s onwards, supplemented by increasing numbers of observations from aircraft, ocean-buoys and other surface platforms, but with a declining number of radiosonde ascents since the late 1980s. The observations used in {ERA}-40 were accumulated from many sources. The first part of this paper describes the data acquisition and the principal changes in data type and coverage over the period. It also describes the data assimilation system used for {ERA}-40. This benefited from many of the changes introduced into operational forecasting since the mid-1990s, when the systems used for the 15-year {ECMWF} re-analysis ({ERA}-15) and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research ({NCEP}/{NCAR}) re-analysis were implemented. Several of the improvements are discussed. General aspects of the production of the analyses are also summarized. A number of results indicative of the overall performance of the data assimilation system, and implicitly of the observing system, are presented and discussed. The comparison of background (short-range) forecasts and analyses with observations, the consistency of the global mass budget, the magnitude of differences between analysis and background fields and the accuracy of medium-range forecasts run from the {ERA}-40 analyses are illustrated. Several results demonstrate the marked improvement that was made to the observing system for the southern hemisphere in the 1970s, particularly towards the end of the decade. In contrast, the synoptic quality of the analysis for the northern hemisphere is sufficient to provide forecasts that remain skilful well into the medium range for all years. Two particular problems are also examined: excessive precipitation over tropical oceans and a too strong Brewer-Dobson circulation, both of which are pronounced in later years. Several other aspects of the quality of the re-analyses revealed by monitoring and validation studies are summarized. Expectations that the ‘second-generation’ {ERA}-40 re-analysis would provide products that are better than those from the firstgeneration {ERA}-15 and {NCEP}/{NCAR} re-analyses are found to have been met in most cases. © Royal Meteorological Society, 2005.

	abstract = {This paper contributes to the understanding of the structure functions used implicitly in the four-dimensional variational assimilation (4D-Var) developed at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts in the last few years. The theoretical equivalence between 4D-Var and the Kalman filter allows us to interpret (after normalization by the error standard deviations) the analysis increments produced by one single observation as the structure functions used implicitly in 4D-Var. The shape of the analysis increments provides a three-dimensional picture of the covariances of the background errors, modified by the dynamics. We study a baroclinic situation and observations have been regularly distributed along a latitude circle crossing the baroclinic wave. Eight standard pressure levels have been considered to sample the vertical. The forecast error standard deviations and the structure functions implied in 4D-Var may differ considerably from those used in the 3D-Var analysis. Unlike 3D-Var, the structure functions are flow dependent: the effective background error standard deviation can be four times larger and the correlation length scale twice as short in the vicinity of a low. A meridional extension of the experimentation at the surface shows that the effective background error standard deviations at 1000 {hPa} are largest in the areas of strong pressure gradient. We quantify the link between the analysis increments produced by 4D-Var and the fastest growing perturbations over the same time interval. In the depression, the explained variance of the analysis increments by the first 13 singular vectors reaches 30\%. The impact of the temporal dimension is assessed. A period of 24 hours seems a minimum for the increments to develop fully baroclinic structures.},

To improve the {TC}'s simulation, this study aimed to use the Weather Research and Forecasting ({WRF}) model to assimilate satellite radiances and surface and upper-air conventional observations cyclically at the intervals of 6 h. The predictive skill of {WRF} with 4D variational (4DVar) and 3D variational (3DVar) data assimilation ({DA}) systems are investigated to examine the added value of 4DVar considering four cyclones namely Vardah, Titli, Bulbul, and Yaas over the North Indian Ocean ({NIO}). Each analysis was subjected to a short-range free forecast, and the estimates obtained from the 4DVar {DA} showed more realistic {TC} characteristics in terms of structure, intensity, rainfall, and track. The simulation of mean sea-level pressure and maximum sustained wind has demonstrated significant improvements in the 4DVar run for all the cases. Furthermore, the vector displacement error in cyclone Vardah was reduced by 54\%–57\% in the 4DVar simulation, whereas this improvement was found to be 9\%–18\% in the case of Titli. More or less similar results were found for Bulbul and Yaas also. Simulation of rainfall also showed marked improvement from the 4DVar scheme. Thus, the performance of the {WRF} model integrated with the 4DVar {DA} method enhanced the simulations of {TC} intensity, tracks, and structures over the {NIO}.},

A hierarchy of atmosphere-only {GCMs}, based on the Hadley Centre Global Environmental Model version 1 ({HadGEM}1) with horizontal resolution increasing from approximately 270 to 60 km at 50°N, is used to systematically investigate the impact of spatial resolution on the simulation of global tropical cyclone activity, independent of model formulation. Tropical cyclones are extracted from ensemble simulations and reanalyses of comparable resolutions using a feature-tracking algorithm. Resolution is critical for simulating storm intensity and convergence to observed storm intensities is not achieved with the model hierarchy. Resolution is less critical for simulating the annual number of tropical cyclones and their geographical distribution, which are well captured at resolutions of 135 km or higher, particularly for Northern Hemisphere basins. Simulating the interannual variability of storm occurrence requires resolutions of 100 km or higher; however, the level of skill is basin dependent. Higher resolution {GCMs} are increasingly able to capture the interannual variability of the large-scale environmental conditions that contribute to tropical cyclogenesis. Different environmental factors contribute to the interannual variability of tropical cyclones in the different basins: in the North Atlantic basin the vertical wind shear, potential intensity, and low-level absolute vorticity are dominant, whereas in the North Pacific basins midlevel relative humidity and low-level absolute vorticity are dominant. Model resolution is crucial for a realistic simulation of tropical cyclone behavior, and high-resolution {GCMs} are found to be valuable tools for investigating the global location and frequency of tropical cyclones.},

Tropical cyclones are identified using a feature-tracking algorithm applied to model output. Tropical cyclones from idealized 30-yr 2×{CO}2 (2CO2) and 4×{CO}2 (4CO2) simulations are compared to those identified in a 150-yr present-day simulation that is separated into a five-member ensemble of 30-yr integrations. Tropical cyclones are shown to decrease in frequency globally by 9\% in the 2CO2 and 26\% in the 4CO2. Tropical cyclones only become more intense in the 4CO2; however, uncoupled time slice experiments reveal an increase in intensity in the 2CO2. An investigation into the large-scale environmental conditions, known to influence tropical cyclone activity in the main development regions, is used to determine the response of tropical cyclone activity to increased atmospheric {CO}2. A weaker Walker circulation and a reduction in zonally averaged regions of updrafts lead to a shift in the location of tropical cyclones in the Northern Hemisphere. A decrease in mean ascent at 500 {hPa} contributes to the reduction of tropical cyclones in the 2CO2 in most basins. The larger reduction of tropical cyclones in the 4CO2 arises from further reduction of the mean ascent at 500 {hPa} and a large enhancement of vertical wind shear, especially in the Southern Hemisphere, North Atlantic, and northeast Pacific.},

The study is conducted using the coupled ocean–atmosphere global climate model {EC}-Earth configured at a relatively high resolution (T159 with 62 vertical levels), which is integrated following the {CMIP}5 protocol. By considering the late twentieth century (1979–2009) in the historical simulation and the twenty-first century end (2070–2100) in the {RCP}4.5 and {RCP}8.5 scenarios, significant future annual mean frequency decreases are found globally and in both hemispheres, accompanied by significant mean lifetime decreases and significant intensity increases, the latter being found through several different measures (but with caveats). In addition, the relatively novel aspect of simulating {TCs} of the past (1900–1930) is studied to further assess the robustness of the climate change results. These results suggest that {TCs} in the early twentieth century were more frequent in the southern hemisphere and dissipated more energy in the southern hemisphere and the South Indian Ocean. Although some model biases are present and the coarse model resolution prevents intense {TCs} in being simulated, reasonable {TC} simulation skill for other metrics (e.g., {TC} genesis, frequency of occurrence) is found when validated against present day observations. Thus the model displays an acceptable ability to connect {TC} climatology with the larger scale circulation.},

	abstract = {The extension of the {ERA}5 reanalysis back to 1950 supplements the previously published segment covering 1979 to the present. It features the assimilation of additional conventional observations, as well as improved use of early satellite data. The number of observations assimilated increases from 53,000 per day in early 1950 to 570,000 per day by the end of 1978. Accordingly, the quality of the reanalysis improves throughout the period, generally joining seamlessly with the segment covering 1979 to the present. The fidelity of the extension is illustrated by the accurate depiction of the North Sea storm of 1953, and the events leading to the first discovery of sudden stratospheric warmings in 1952. Time series of {ERA}5 global surface temperature anomalies show temperatures to be relatively stable from 1950 until the late 1970s, in agreement with the other contemporary full-input reanalysis covering this period and with independent data sets, although there are significant differences in the accuracy of representing specific regions, Europe being well represented in the early period but Australia less so. The variability of {ERA}5 precipitation from month to month agrees well with observations for all continents, with correlations above 90\% for most of Europe and generally in excess of 70\% for North America, Asia and Australia. The evolution of upper air temperatures, humidities and winds shows smoothly varying behaviour, including tropospheric warming and stratospheric cooling, modulated by volcanic eruptions. The Quasi-Biennial Oscillation is well represented throughout. Aspects to be improved upon in future reanalyses include the assimilation of tropical cyclone data, the spin-up of soil moisture and stratospheric humidity, and the representation of surface temperatures over Australia.},

A 2°C anthropogenic global warming is projected to impact {TC} activity as follows. 1) The most confident {TC}-related projection is that sea level rise accompanying the warming will lead to higher storm inundation levels, assuming all other factors are unchanged. 2) For {TC} precipitation rates, there is at least medium-to-high confidence in an increase globally, with a median projected increase of 14\%, or close to the rate of tropical water vapor increase with warming, at constant relative humidity. 3) For {TC} intensity, 10 of 11 authors had at least medium-to-high confidence that the global average will increase. The median projected increase in lifetime maximum surface wind speeds is about 5\% (range: 1\%–10\%) in available higher-resolution studies. 4) For the global proportion (as opposed to frequency) of {TCs} that reach very intense (category 4–5) levels, there is at least medium-to-high confidence in an increase, with a median projected change of +13\%. Author opinion was more mixed and confidence levels lower for the following projections: 5) a further poleward expansion of the latitude of maximum {TC} intensity in the western North Pacific; 6) a decrease of global {TC} frequency, as projected in most studies; 7) an increase in global very intense {TC} frequency (category 4–5), seen most prominently in higher-resolution models; and 8) a slowdown in {TC} translation speed.},

However, the response of {TCs} to a warming or changing climate has been the subject of considerable research, often with conflicting results. In this study, the abilities of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project ({CMIP}) Phase 6 ({CMIP}6) models to simulate {TC} genesis are assessed through historical simulations. The results indicate that a systematic humidity bias persists in most {CMIP}6 models from corresponding {CMIP} Phase 5 models, which leads to an overestimation of climatological {TC} genesis. However, the annual cycle of {TC} genesis is well captured by {CMIP}6 models. The abilities of 25 models to simulate the geographical patterns of {TC} genesis vary significantly. In addition, seven models are identified as well simulated models, but seven models are identified as poorly simulated ones. A comparison of the environmental variables for {TC} genesis in the well-simulated group and the poorly simulated group identifies moisture in the mid-troposphere as a key factor in the realistic simulation of El Niño-Southern Oscillation ({ENSO}) impacts on {TC} genesis. In contrast with the observations, the poorly simulated group does not reproduce the suppressing effect of negative moisture anomalies on {TC} genesis in the northwestern region (20°–30°N, 120°–145°E) during El Niño years. Given the interaction between {TC} and {ENSO}, these results provide a guidance for future {TC} projections under climate change by {CMIP}6 models.},

However, the relative roles of the thermodynamic versus dynamic environmental factors in {TC} genesis remain elusive, especially under a warming world. Here we show that four leading dynamic factors, the 850 {hPa} absolute vorticity, 500 {hPa} vertical motion, tropospheric vertical wind shear, and 500 {hPa} shear vorticity of zonal winds, are objectively identified by the logarithmic stepwise regression analysis from 11 dynamic and thermodynamic candidate factors. We further demonstrate that the model results from a {TC}-permitting global model ascertain the four leading dynamical factors as the most influential in both the present-day simulation and future projection under global warming. A dynamic {GPI}, consisting of the four dynamic parameters, provides a diagnostic tool for understanding future change of {TC} genesis. Meanwhile, it improves skills in representing interannual variations of {TCG} frequency in the western Pacific and Southern Hemisphere oceans.},

We assess their performances by tracking {TCs} in the {ERA}5 reanalysis and by comparing the outcome to the {IBTrACS} observations database.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}We find typical detection rates of the trackers around 80 \%. At the same time, false alarm rates ({FARs}) greatly vary across the four trackers and can sometimes exceed the number of genuine cyclones detected. Based on the finding that many of these false alarms ({FAs}) are extra-tropical cyclones ({ETCs}), we adapt two existing filtering methods common to all trackers. Both post-treatments dramatically impact {FARs}, which range from 9 \% to 36 \% in our final catalogs of {TC} tracks. We then show that different traditional metrics can be very sensitive to the particular choice of tracker, which is particularly true for the {TC} frequencies and their durations. By contrast, all trackers identify a robust negative bias in {ERA}5 {TC} intensities, a result already noted in previous studies.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}We conclude by advising against using as many trackers as possible and averaging the results.

However, their formulation is generally derived from simple statistical models (e.g., multiple linear regression) and are not optimised globally. In this paper, we present a simple framework for optimising genesis indexes given a user-specified trade-off between two performance metrics, which measure how well an index captures the spatial and interannual variability of tropical cyclone genesis. We apply the proposed framework to the popular Emanuel and Nolan Genesis Potential Index, yielding new, optimised formulas that correspond to different trade-offs between spatial and interannual variability. Results show that our refined indexes can improve the performance of the Emanuel and Nolan index up to 8\% for spatial variability and 16-22\% for interannual variability; this improvement was found to be statistically significant (p{\textless}0.01). Lastly, by analysing the formulas found, we give some insights into the role of the different inputs of the index in maximising one metric or the other.},

	abstract = {The new {CNRM}-{CM}6 release of the {CNRM}/{CERFACS} atmospheric general circulation model has been used in a rotated/stretched configuration that allows a local horizontal resolution of less than 15 km over the tropical North Atlantic basin. Sea surface temperatures ({SST}) arise from a previous lower resolution simulation of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project-5 exercise and corrected through a quantile–quantile method. Moreover, five-member ensemble simulations have been performed for both present and {RCP}8.5 scenario climates. For validation purposes, another five-member ensemble simulation has been performed with prescribed observed {SST}. Tracking of tropical cyclones ({TCs}) in these simulations reveals that the intensity of the simulated {TCs} are quite realistic and may reach the strongest hurricane ever observed, allowing to distinguish between {TC} categories in the analysis. Although the model tends to underestimate the occurrence of {TCs} over low latitudes, the realism of simulated {TCs} has nevertheless improved compared to previous versions of the model, due to both increased resolution and changes in the parameterizations used in the model. Changes observed in the simulations between present and future climates confirm previous results stating that there is no clear change in the overall number of {TCs} but an increase in the intensity of major hurricanes as well as an increase of rainfall in all {TC} categories. A new result suggests that {TC} activity response to climate warming may be significantly different from 1 month of the hurricane season to another. In our simulations we observe a robust decrease of {TCs} in the tropics in July while August and September experience a large increase of {TCs} over the mid-latitudes. Finally, we find a relation between a large increase in {TC} activity near the African coast and changes in the African atmospheric dynamics and rainfall in September.},

	abstract = {Although the life-cycle of tropical cyclones is relatively well understood, many of the underlying physical processes occur at scales below those resolved by global climate models ({GCMs}). Projecting future changes in tropical cyclone characteristics thus remains challenging. We propose a methodology, based on dynamical system metrics, to reconstruct the statistics of cyclone intensities in coarse-resolution datasets, where maximum wind speed and minimum sea-level pressure may not be accurately represented. We base our analysis on 411 tropical cyclones occurring between 2010 and 2020, using both {ERA}5 reanalysis data and observations from the {HURDAT}2 database, as well as a control simulation of the {IPSL}-{CM}6A-{ATM}-{ICO}-{HR} model. Using {ERA}5 data, we compute two dynamical system metrics related to the number of degrees of freedom of the atmospheric flow and to the coupling between different atmospheric variables, namely the local dimension and the co-recurrence ratio. We then use {HURDAT}2 data to develop a univariate quantile--quantile bias correction conditioned on these two metrics, as well as a multivariate correction method. The conditional approach outperforms a conventional univariate correction of the sea-level pressure data only, pointing to the usefulness of the dynamical systems metrics introduced. We then show that the multivariate approach can be used to recover a realistic distribution of cyclone intensities from comparatively coarse-resolution model data.},

The {SA} is performed by tracking {TCs} in four different reanalyses. Tracked {TC} trajectories are compared to a pointwise observational record. Results show that using thermally integrated metrics for isolating {TC} warm cores is superior to single-temperature levels. Input thresholds defining {TC} vortex strength during tracking contribute the most variance in all output metrics. Integrated output metrics (such as accumulated cyclone energy) are less variable than “counting” metrics such as {TC} frequency. {MM} greatly reduces the computational requirements for tracker optimization, with tracked {TCs} demonstrating better hit and false alarm rates than previous studies.},

It is also found that relative increase in {TC} rainfall between the second half of the 20th and 21st centuries may surpass the rate of change suggested by the Clausius–Clapeyron formula.

Because {TC} attributes (e.g., genesis, track and landfall locations, intensity) are largely controlled by large-scale environmental conditions, {TC} activity can be substantially altered by {ENSO}, via {ENSO}’s strong modulation on both the atmosphere and ocean. Atmospheric modulations include changes in vertical wind shear, humidity, low-level vorticity, and the strength and position of subtropical highs. The ocean influences {TCs} via changes in sea-surface temperature and upper ocean heat content and structure. This chapter will focus on {ENSO}’s influences on {TC} basins around the globe, including local effects and remote influences via teleconnections. These basins include the western North Pacific, central-eastern North Pacific, North Atlantic, North Indian Ocean, and Southern Hemisphere (South Pacific and South Indian Ocean). We will also discuss additional factors that, together with {ENSO}, are important for {TC} prediction and projection, including other modes of natural climate variability and anthropogenic climate change.},

	abstract = {El Niño/Southern Oscillation, the dominant mode of interannual climate variability, strongly influences tropical cyclone activity. During canonical El Niño, the warm phase, Atlantic tropical cyclones are suppressed. However, the past decades have witnessed different El Niño characteristics, ranging from warming over the east Pacific cold tongue in canonical events to warming near the warm pool, known as warm pool El Niño or central Pacific El Niño. Global climate models project possible future increases in intensity of warm pool El Niño. Here we use a climate model at a resolution sufficient to explicitly simulate tropical cyclones to investigate how these flavours of El Niño may affect such cyclones. We show that Atlantic tropical cyclones are suppressed regardless of El Niño type. For the warmest 10\% of each El Niño flavour, warm pool El Niño is substantially less effective at suppressing Atlantic tropical cyclones than cold tongue El Niño. However, for the same absolute warming intensity, the opposite is true. This is because less warming is required near the warm pool to satisfy the sea surface temperature threshold for deep convection, which leads to tropical cyclone suppression through vertical wind shear enhancements. We conclude that an understanding of future changes in not only location, but also intensity and frequency, of El Niño is important for forecasts and projections of Atlantic tropical cyclone activity.},

The {ROC} curve has true positive rate (also called sensitivity or recall) on the y axis and false positive rate on the x axis, and the {ROC} {AUC} can range from 0 (worst result) to 1 (perfect result). The {ROC} {AUC}, however, has several flaws and drawbacks. This score is generated including predictions that obtained insufficient sensitivity and specificity, and moreover it does not say anything about positive predictive value (also known as precision) nor negative predictive value ({NPV}) obtained by the classifier, therefore potentially generating inflated overoptimistic results. Since it is common to include {ROC} {AUC} alone without precision and negative predictive value, a researcher might erroneously conclude that their classification was successful. Furthermore, a given point in the {ROC} space does not identify a single confusion matrix nor a group of matrices sharing the same {MCC} value. Indeed, a given (sensitivity, specificity) pair can cover a broad {MCC} range, which casts doubts on the reliability of {ROC} {AUC} as a performance measure. In contrast, the Matthews correlation coefficient ({MCC}) generates a high score in its \$\$[-1; +1]\$\$interval only if the classifier scored a high value for all the four basic rates of the confusion matrix: sensitivity, specificity, precision, and negative predictive value. A high {MCC} (for example, {MCC} \$\$=\$\$0.9), moreover, always corresponds to a high {ROC} {AUC}, and not vice versa. In this short study, we explain why the Matthews correlation coefficient should replace the {ROC} {AUC} as standard statistic in all the scientific studies involving a binary classification, in all scientific fields.},

 First, we focus on the climatology of Mediterranean cyclone tracks, their relationship to large-scale atmospheric circulation and their future trends. Second, we discuss the dynamics and atmospheric processes that govern the genesis and development of Mediterranean cyclones. Then, we present the different subtypes of Mediterranean cyclones, devoting special attention to medicanes, i.e. cyclones with tropical characteristics and subjects of numerous recent studies. In a subsequent section, we review the state of the art in forecasting cyclones and relevant high-impact weather, and we discuss in detail the challenges and recent efforts to increase their forecast skill. Finally, we discuss the main impacts produced by cyclones, namely heavy precipitation, windstorms, dust transport, storm surges and sea wave extremes.

 In the last section of this review article, we thoroughly outline the future directions of research that would advance the broader field of Mediterranean cyclones.},

Near the earth's surface, the general features of the time mean flow field and the location of the inter-tropical convergence zone of the model compare favorably with those of the actual atmosphere. Along the convergence zone or shear line, disturbances with a characteristic scale of 2000–3000 km develop and cause heavy precipitation. They tend to develop in the geographical areas where the formation of actual tropical storms is most probable. In the upper troposphere of the model tropics, disturbances with planetary scale develop and are responsible for the maximum of eddy kinetic energy there. In general, both the kinetic energy of the tropical cyclones and that of the planetary-scale disturbances in the model tropics are chiefly maintained by the conversion of available potential energy generated by the heat of condensation. However, the planetary-scale disturbances in the upper troposphere of the tropics seem to be also affected by various factors such as the interaction with higher latitudes and land–sea contrast. It is noteworthy that these disturbances transport angular momentum across the equator in the upper troposphere and strongly affect the budget of angular momentum in the model tropics.},

The results of global-scale numerical simulations without cumulus parameterization were used, with a horizontal mesh size of 7 km. On average, azimuthally averaged maximum tangential velocities at 850 (925) {hPa} in the simulated {TCs} were 0.72\% (1.95\%) faster than gradient wind–balanced tangential velocity ({GWV}) during quasi-steady periods. Of the simulated {TCs}, 75\% satisfied the gradient wind balance at the radius of maximum wind speed ({RMW}) at 850 and at 925 {hPa} to within about 4.0\%. These results were qualitatively similar to those obtained during the intensification phase. In contrast, averages of the maximum and minimum deviations from the {GWV}, in all the azimuths at the {RMW}, achieved up to 40\% of the maximum tangential velocity. Azimuthally averaged tangential velocities exceeded the {GWV} (i.e., supergradient) inside the {RMW} in the lower troposphere, whereas the velocities were close to or slightly slower than {GWV} (i.e., subgradient) in the other regions. The tangential velocities at 925 {hPa} were faster (slower) in the right-hand (left hand) side of the {TC} motion. When the tangential velocities at the {RMW} were supergradient, the primary circulation tended to decay rapidly in the vertical direction and slowly in the radial direction, and the eyewall updraft and the {RMW} were at larger radii. Statistical analyses revealed that the {TC} with supergradient wind at the {RMW} at 850 {hPa} was characterized by stronger intensity, larger {RMW}, more axisymmetric structure, and an intensity stronger than potential intensity.},

Calculating {TC} risk at a global scale, however, has proven difficult given the limited temporal and spatial information on {TCs} across much of the global coastline. Here, we present a novel database on {TC} characteristics on a global scale using a newly developed synthetic resampling algorithm we call {STORM} (Synthetic Tropical {cyclOne} {geneRation} Model). {STORM} can be applied to any meteorological dataset to statistically resample and model {TC} tracks and intensities. We apply {STORM} to extracted {TCs} from 38 years of historical data from {IBTrACS} to statistically extend this dataset to 10,000 years of {TC} activity. We show that {STORM} preserves the {TC} statistics as found in the original dataset. The {STORM} dataset can be used for {TC} hazard assessments and risk modeling in {TC}-prone regions.},

	abstract = {The frequency with which tropical cyclones ({TCs}) occur controls all other aspects of tropical cyclone risk since a storm that does not occur can do no harm. Yet this frequency is poorly understood. There is no accepted theory that explains the average number of {TCs} that occur each year on the Earth, nor how that number will change with global warming. Arguments based on global budgets of heat or moisture do not yet appear helpful, nor does a detailed understanding of the physical processes of {TC} genesis. Empirical indices that predict {TC} frequency as a function of large-scale environmental variables can explain some of its relative variations in space and time, but not its absolute value. Global numerical models with horizontal grid spacings on the order of 25–50 km have allowed much improved simulations of {TC} activity, however. Many such models project a decrease in frequency with warming, but some project an increase. Idealized simulations, including those at higher resolutions, offer promise by allowing a systematic, deductive investigation of the roles of individual environmental factors. In addition to the larger-scale environmental modulation of genesis likelihood, precursor disturbances, or “seeds”, may exert an independent influence on {TC} frequency.},

	abstract = {Abstract The development of Hurricane Catarina over the western South Atlantic Ocean in March 2004 marks the first time that the existence of a hurricane has been confirmed by analysis and satellite imagery in the South Atlantic basin. The storm undergoes a complex life cycle, beginning as an extratropical precursor that moves east-southeastward off the Brazilian coast and toward the midlatitudes. Its eastward progress is halted and the system is steered back westward toward the Brazilian coast as it encounters a strengthening dipole-blocking structure east of the South American continent. Entering the large region of weak vertical shear that characterizes this blocking pattern, Catarina begins a tropical transition process over anomalously cool 25°C ocean waters above which an elevated potential intensity is supported by the cold upper-level air associated with the trough component of the block. As the convective outflow from the developing tropical system reinforces the ridge component of the dipole block, the storm is accelerated westward toward the Santa Catarina province of Brazil and makes landfall there as a nominal category-1 hurricane, causing extensive damage with its heavy rains and strong winds. The complex evolution of the system is analyzed using a suite of diagnostic tools, and a conceptual model of the tropical transition and steering processes in the presence of a dipole block is developed. Once the essential properties of the upper-level flow are established, an analog study is undertaken to investigate lower-atmospheric responses to similar blocking regimes. Persistent dipole-blocking structures are found to be rare east of South America; however, the evolution of systems occurring during these periods is shown to be complex and to exhibit various subtropical development modes.},
